	Abstract = {This paper details the implementation of state-of-the-art whole-body control algorithms on the humanoid robot iCub. We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

	Abstract = {This review is the result of a joint reflection carried out by researchers in the fields of robotics and automatic control on the one hand and neuroscience on the other, both trying to answer the same question: what are the functional bases of bipedal locomotion and how can they be controlled? The originality of this work is to synthesize the two approaches in order to take advantage of the knowledge concerning the adaptability and reactivity performances of humans and of the rich tools and formal concepts available in biped robotics. Indeed, we claim that the theoretical framework of robotics can enhance our understanding of human postural control by formally expressing the experimental concepts used in neuroscience. Conversely, biological knowledge of human posture and gait can inspire biped robot design and control. Therefore, both neuroscientists and roboticists should find useful information in this paper.},

@article{Bateni2005,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide information on the advantages and possible disadvantages of using canes and walkers. DATA SOURCES: English-language articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and PubMed (1966-May 2003) for key words cane or walker , excluding articles unrelated to mobility aids. Bibliographies were reviewed and ISI Web of Science citation searches were run to identify additional references. Over 1000 articles were selected for further evaluation. STUDY SELECTION: We extracted all studies of single-tip canes or pickup walkers addressing: (1) functional, biomechanic, or neuromotor benefits; (2) biomechanic, attentional, neuromotor, metabolic, or physiologic demands; and (3) falls, injuries, or other problems. We included approximately 10\% of the articles originally identified. DATA EXTRACTION: The methodology of each selected article, and findings relevant to the benefits, demands, or adverse effects of cane or walker use were summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: Findings were synthesized by considering their relation to basic biomechanic principles. Some biomechanic findings appear to support the clinical view that canes and walkers can improve balance and mobility for older adults and people with other clinical conditions. However, a large proportion of users experience difficulties, and the use of such devices is associated with increased risk of falling. A small number of studies have characterized some of the specific demands and problems associated with using mobility aids. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and biomechanic evaluations of canes and walkers confirm that these devices can improve balance and mobility. However, they can also interfere with ones ability to maintain balance in certain situations, and the strength and metabolic demands can be excessive. More research is needed to identify and solve specific problems. Such research may lead to improved designs and guidelines for safer use of canes and walkers.},

@article{Corbeil2013,
	Abstract = {Perturbation of whole-body stability often evokes rapid arm reactions. It has been suggested that the earliest arm activation is a generic (e.g. startle-like) response to which a later stabilizing (e.g. counterweight or reach-to-grasp) or impact-protection component can be appended. To examine whether the initial part of the reaction is generic, we examined arm reactions evoked by small balance perturbations in 12 healthy young adults while varying perturbation direction (rightward or forward platform translation) and environmental conditions (handrail present or absent). The perturbation magnitude was selected to be sufficiently small to obviate the need to use the arms for stabilization. To avoid adaptation or habituation, analysis focused on each subject's very first exposure to the perturbation. Most subjects exhibited active movement of both arms in reaction to the perturbation, but there was large (non-stereotypical) inter-subject variation in muscle-onset latency and arm kinematics. Furthermore, the velocity and direction of the initial arm movement were affected by perturbation direction, in a manner consistent with functional strategies (counterweight strategy in backward falls, hybrid counterweight/protective strategy in leftward falls). Although subjects never contacted the handrail, responses were slower when it was present. These results are not consistent with a generic stereotyped response, but suggest instead that even the earliest component of first-trial arm reactions was functionally modulated.},

@article{Dimitrova2004,
	Abstract = {The postural adaptation impairments of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suggest that the basal ganglia may be important for quickly modifying muscle activation patterns when the direction of perturbation or stance conditions suddenly change. It is unknown whether their particular instability to backward postural perturbations is due to specific abnormalities of parkinsonian postural muscle synergies in that direction and not present in other directions. In the present study, we test this hypothesis by comparing the patterns of leg and trunk muscle activation in 13 subjects with PD and 13 control subjects in response to eight randomly presented directions of horizontal surface translations while standing with either narrow or wide stance. The direction of maximum activation for each muscle was similar for PD and control subjects, suggesting that the basal ganglia is not critical for programming externally triggered postural synergies. However, antagonist muscle activation was earlier and larger in PD than in control subjects, resulting in coactivation. PD subjects also did not increase the magnitude of muscle activation as much as did control subjects when changing from wide to narrow stance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PD results in an inability to shape the pattern and magnitude of postural muscle responses for changes in perturbation direction and in stance position.},

@article{Henry1998,
	Abstract = {To characterize muscle synergy organization underlying multidirectional control of stance posture, electromyographic activity was recorded from 11 lower limb and trunk muscles of 7 healthy subjects while they were subjected to horizontal surface translations in 12 different, randomly presented directions. The latency and amplitude of muscle responses were quantified for each perturbation direction. Tuning curves for each muscle were examined to relate the amplitude of the muscle response to the direction of surface translation. The latencies of responses for the shank and thigh muscles were constant, regardless of perturbation direction. In contrast, the latencies for another thigh [tensor fascia latae (TFL)] and two trunk muscles [rectus abdominis (RAB) and erector spinae (ESP)] were either early or late, depending on the perturbation direction. These three muscles with direction-specific latencies may play different roles in postural control as prime movers or as stabilizers for different translation directions, depending on the timing of recruitment. Most muscle tuning curves were within one quadrant, having one direction of maximal activity, generally in response to diagonal surface translations. Two trunk muscles (RAB and ESP) and two lower limb muscles (semimembranosus and peroneus longus) had bipolar tuning curves, with two different directions of maximal activity, suggesting that these muscle can play different roles as part of different synergies, depending on translation direction. Muscle tuning curves tended to group into one of three regions in response to 12 different directions of perturbations. Two muscles [rectus femoris (RFM) and TFL] were maximally active in response to lateral surface translations. The remaining muscles clustered into one of two diagonal regions. The diagonal regions corresponded to the two primary directions of active horizontal force vector responses. Two muscles (RFM and adductor longus) were maximally active orthogonal to their predicted direction of maximal activity based on anatomic orientation. Some of the muscles in each of the synergic regions were not anatomic synergists, suggesting a complex central organization for recruitment of muscles. The results suggest that neither a simple reflex mechanism nor a fixed muscle synergy organization is adequate to explain the muscle activation patterns observed in this postural control task. Our results are consistent with a centrally mediated pattern of muscle latencies combined with peripheral influence on muscle magnitude. We suggest that a flexible continuum of muscle synergies that are modifiable in a task-dependent manner be used for equilibrium control in stance.},

@article{Horak1986,
	Abstract = {We studied the extent to which automatic postural actions in standing human subjects are organized by a limited repertoire of central motor programs. Subjects stood on support surfaces of various lengths, which forced them to adopt different postural movement strategies to compensate for the same external perturbations. We assessed whether a continuum or a limited set of muscle activation patterns was used to produce different movement patterns and the extent to which movement patterns were influenced by prior experience. Exposing subjects standing on a normal support surface to brief forward and backward horizontal surface perturbations elicited relatively stereotyped patterns of leg and trunk muscle activation with 73- to 110-ms latencies. Activity began in the ankle joint muscles and then radiated in sequence to thigh and then trunk muscles on the same dorsal or ventral aspect of the body. This activation pattern exerted compensatory torques about the ankle joints, which restored equilibrium by moving the body center of mass forward or backward. This pattern has been termed the ankle strategy because it restores equilibrium by moving the body primarily around the ankle joints. To successfully maintain balance while standing on a support surface short in relation to foot length, subjects activated leg and trunk muscles at similar latencies but organized the activity differently. The trunk and thigh muscles antagonistic to those used in the ankle strategy were activated in the opposite proximal-to-distal sequence, whereas the ankle muscles were generally unresponsive. This activation pattern produced a compensatory horizontal shear force against the support surface but little, if any, ankle torque. This pattern has been termed the hip strategy, because the resulting motion is focused primarily about the hip joints. Exposing subjects to horizontal surface perturbations while standing on support surfaces intermediate in length between the shortest and longest elicited more complex postural movements and associated muscle activation patterns that resembled ankle and hip strategies combined in different temporal relations. These complex postural movements were executed with combinations of torque and horizontal shear forces and motions of ankle and hip joints. During the first 5-20 practice trials immediately following changes from one support surface length to another, response latencies were unchanged. The activation patterns, however, were complex and resembled the patterns observed during well-practiced stance on surfaces of intermediate lengths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Change-in-support strategies, involving stepping or grasping movements of the limbs, are prevalent reactions to instability and appear to play a more important functional role in maintaining upright stance than has generally been appreciated. Contrary to traditional views, change-in-support reactions are not just strategies of last resort, but are often initiated well before the center of mass is near the stability limits of the base of support. Furthermore, it appears that subjects, when given the option, will select these reactions in preference to the fixed-support "hip strategy" that has been purported to be of functional importance. The rapid speed of compensatory change-in-support reactions distinguishes them from "volitional" arm and leg movements. In addition, compensatory stepping reactions often lack the anticipatory control elements that are invariably present in non-compensatory stepping, such as gait initiation. Even when present, these anticipatory adjustments appear to have little functional value during rapid compensatory movements. Lateral destabilization complicates the control of compensatory stepping, a finding that may be particularly relevant to the problem of falls and hip fractures in elderly people. Older adults appear to have problems in controlling lateral stability when stepping to recover balance, even when responding to anteroposterior perturbation. Increased understanding and awareness of change-in-support reactions should lead to development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for detecting and treating specific causes of imbalance and falling in elderly people and in patients with balance impairments.},

We measured muscle activity at the shoulder, and the lower leg, during unconstrained responses to platform translation. Results revealed very early activation in shoulder muscles, similar in timing to the 'automatic' ankle responses. The arm activation occurred even when the reaction provided no immediate defence against destabilization but would appear to be more than a 'startle' response, since the activation was scaled to the perturbation magnitude and persisted even when perturbations were expected. The arm activation would appear to be driven from a remote sensory source, since there was negligible loading or stretch of the arm muscles.},

@article{Mergner2007,
	Abstract = {We model human postural control of upright stance during external disturbances and voluntary lean. Our focus is on how data from various sensors are combined to estimate these disturbances. Whereas most current engineering models of multisensory estimation rely on "internal observers" and complex processing, we compute our estimates by simple sensor fusion mechanisms, i.e., weighted sums of sensory signals combined with thresholds. We show with simulations that this simple device mimics human-like postural behavior in a wide range of situations and diseases. We have now embodied our mechanism in a biped humanoid robot to show that it works in the real world with complex, noisy, and imperfectly known sensors and effectors. On the other hand, we find that the more complex, internal-observer approach, when applied to bipedal posture, can also yield human-like behavior. We suggest that humans use both mechanisms: simple, fast sensor fusions with thresholding for automatic reactions (default mechanism), and more complex methods for voluntary movements. We suggest also that the fusion with thresholding mechanisms are optimized during phylogenesis but are mainly hardwired in any one organism, whereas sensorimotor learning and optimization is mainly a domain of the internal observers.},

@article{Nawayseh2006,
	Abstract = {Oscillatory motions can cause injury in transport when standing passengers or crew lose balance and fall. To predict the loss of balance of standing people, a model is required of the relationship between the input motion and the stability of the human body. This experimental study investigated the effect of frequency, magnitude and direction of oscillation on the postural stability of standing subjects and whether response to rotational oscillation can be predicted from knowledge of response to translational oscillation. Twelve male subjects stood on a floor that oscillated in either horizontal (fore-and-aft or lateral) or rotational (pitch or roll) directions. The oscillations were one-third octave bands of random motion centred on five preferred octave centre frequencies (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0Hz). The horizontal motions were presented at each of four velocities (0.04, 0.062, 0.099, and 0.16ms−1 rms) and the rotational motions were presented at each of four rotational angles (0.73, 1.46, 2.92, and 5.85$\,^{\circ}$rms) corresponding to four accelerations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0ms−2 rms), where the acceleration is that caused by rotation through the gravitational vector. Postural stability was determined by subjective methods and by measuring the displacement of the centre of pressure at the feet during horizontal oscillation. During horizontal oscillation, increases in motion magnitude increased instability and, with the same velocity at all frequencies from 0.125 to 2.0Hz, most instability occurred in the region of 0.5Hz. Fore-and-aft oscillation produced more instability than lateral oscillation, although displacements of the centre of pressure were similar in both directions. With the same angular displacement at all frequencies from 0.125 to 2.0Hz, pitch oscillation caused more instability than roll oscillation, but in both directions instability increased with increased frequency of oscillation. Frequency weightings for acceleration in the plane of the floor during translational and rotational excitation show the significance of low-frequency translational oscillation and high-frequency rotational motion, and show that it is necessary to know whether the measured acceleration is caused by translation or rotation through gravity.},

@article{Sarraf2014,
	Abstract = {Maintaining balance while standing on a moving bus or subway is challenging, and falls among passengers are a significant source of morbidity. Standing passengers often rely on handrail grasping to resist perturbations to balance. We conducted experiments that simulated vehicle starts, to examine how handrail location (overhead or shoulder-height), perturbation direction (forward, backward, left or right), and perturbation magnitude (1 or 2m/s(2)) affected the biomechanical effort (peak centre-of-pressure (COP) excursion and hand force) and muscle activations (onset and integrated EMG activity) involved in balance maintenance. COP excursions, hand forces and muscle activations were altered in a functional manner based on task constraints and perturbation characteristics. Handrail position affected normalized values of peak COP and hand force during forward and backward, but not sideways perturbations. During backward perturbations, COP excursion was greater when grasping overhead than shoulder-height. During forward perturbations, hand force was greater when grasping shoulder-height than overhead. Biceps activations were earlier during shoulder-height than overhead grasping, while tibialis anterior activity was higher during overhead than shoulder-height grasping. Our results indicate that, when facing forward or backward to the direction of vehicle motion, overhead grasping minimizes hand force, while shoulder-height grasping minimizes COP excursion. In contrast, grasping with a sideways stance eliminates the effect of handrail location, and was associated with equal or lower biomechanical effort. This suggests that, at least for vehicle starts, the most reasonable strategy may be to stand sideways to the direction of the vehicle movement, and grasp either at shoulder-height or overhead.},

@article{Wing2011,
	Abstract = {Sensory information about body sway is used to drive corrective muscle action to keep the body's centre of mass located over the base of support provided by the feet. Loss of vision, by closing the eyes, usually results in increased sway as indexed by fluctuations (i.e. standard deviation, s.d.) in the velocity of a marker at C7 on the neck, s.d. dC7. Variability in the rate of change of centre of pressure (s.d. dCoP), which indexes corrective muscle action, also increases during upright standing with eyes closed. Light touch contact by the tip of one finger with an environmental surface can reduce s.d. dC7 and s.d. dCoP as effectively as opening the eyes. We review studies of light touch and balance and then describe a novel paradigm for studying the nature of somatosensory information contributing to effects of light touch balance. We show that 'light tight touch' contact by the index finger held in the thimble of a haptic device results in increased anteroposterior (AP) sway with entraining by either simple or complex AP sinusoidal oscillations of the haptic device. Moreover, sway is also increased when the haptic device plays back the pre-recorded AP sway path of another person. Cross-correlations between hand and C7 motion reveal a 176 ms lead for the hand and we conclude that light tight touch affords an efficient route for somatosensory feedback support for balance. Furthermore, we suggest that the paradigm has potential to contribute to the understanding of interpersonal postural coordination with light touch in future research.},

@article{Winter1995,
	Abstract = {The common denominator in the assessment of human balance and posture is the inverted pendulum model. If we focus on appropriate versions of the model we can use it to identify the gravitational and acceleration perturbations and pinpoint the motor mechanisms that can defend against any perturbation. We saw that in quiet standing an ankle strategy applies only in the direction and that a separate hip load/unload strategy by the hip abd/adductors is the totally dominant defence in the direction when standing with feet side by side. In other standing positions (tandem, or intermediate) the two mechanisms still work separately, but their roles reverse. In the tandem position balance is an ankle mechanism (invertors/evertors) while in the direction a hip load/unloading mechanism dominates. During initiation and termination of gait these two separate mechanisms control the trajectory of the COP to ensure the desired acceleration and deceleration of the COM. During initiation the initial acceleration of the COM forward towards the stance limb is achieved by a posterior and lateral movement of the COP towards the swing limb. After this release phase there is a sudden loading of the stance limb which shifts the COP to the stance limb. The COM is now accelerated forward and laterally towards the future position of the swinging foot. Also shifts of the COP were controlled by the hip abductors/adductors and all shifts were under the control of the ankle plantar/dorsiflexors. During termination the trajectory of both COM and COP reverse. As the final weight-bearing on the stance foot takes place the COM is passing forward along the medial border of that foot. Hyperactivity of that foot's plantarflexors takes the COP forward and when the final foot begins to bear weight the COP moves rapidly across and suddenly stops at a position ahead of the future position of the COM. Then the plantarflexors of both feet release and allow the COP to move posteriorly and approach the COM and meet it as quiet stance is achieved. The inverted pendulum model permitted us to understand the separate roles of the two mechanisms during these critical unbalancing and rebalancing periods. During walking the inverted pendulum model explained the dynamics of the balance of HAT in both the and directions. Here the model includes the couple due to the acceleration of the weight-bearing hip as well as gravitational perturbations. The exclusive control of balance and posture are the hip extensors and flexors, while in the direction the dominant control is with the hip abductors with very minor adductor involvement. At the ankle the inverted pendulum model sees the COM passing forward along the medial border to the weight-bearing foot. The model predicts that during single support the body is falling forward and being accelerated medially towards the future position of the swing foot. The model predicts an insignificant role of the ankle invertors/evertors in the control. Rather, the future position of the swing foot is the critical variable or more specifically the lateral displacement from the COM at the start of single support. The position is actually under the control of the hip abd/adductors during the previous early swing phase. The critical importance of the hip abductors/adductors in balance during all phases of standing and walking is now evident. This separate mechanism is important from a neural control perspective and clinically it focuses major attention on therapy and potential problems with some surgical procedures. On the other hand the minuscule role of the ankle invertors/evertors is important to note. Except for the tandem standing position these muscles have negligible involvement in balance control.},

is presented. It provides pressuremeasurements and shape information
about the contactsurfaces between the robot and the environment.
The system isbased on a mesh of sensors interconnected in order to
form anetworked structure. Each sensor has 12 capacitive taxels,
hasa triangular shape and is supported by a flexible substrate inorder
to conform to smooth curved surfaces. Threecommunications ports placed
along the sides of each sensorsides allow communications with adjacent
sensors. The tactilemeasurements are sent to embed microcontroller
boards usingserial bus communication links. The system can adaptivelyreduce
its spatial resolution, improving the response time. Thisfeature
is very useful for detecting the first contact veryrapidly, at a
lower spatial resolution, and then increase thespatial resolution
in the region of contact for accuratereconstruction of the contact
pressure distribution.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new method for calculating operational-space
inertia matrices, and other related quantities, for branched kinematic
trees. It is based on the exploitation of branch-induced sparsity
in the joint-space inertia matrix and the task Jacobian. Detailed
cost figures are given for the new method, and its efficacy is demonstrated
by means of a realistic example based on the ASIMO Next-Generation
humanoid robot. In this example, the new method is shown to be 6.7
times faster than the basic matrix method, and 1.6 times faster than
the efficient low-order algorithm of Rodriguez et al. Furthermore,
cost savings of more than 50,000 arithmetic operations are obtained
in the calculation of the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse of the task
Jacobian and its null-space projection matrix. Additional examples
are considered briefly, in order to further compare the new method
with the algorithm of Rodriguez et al. 10.1177/0278364909357644},

@article{Kulic2007,
	Abstract = {Safe planning and control is essential to bringing human-robot interaction
into common experience. This paper presents an integrated human?robot
interaction strategy that ensures the safety of the human participant
through a coordinated suite of safety strategies that are selected
and implemented to anticipate and respond to varying time horizons
for potential hazards and varying expected levels of interaction
with the user. The proposed planning and control strategies are based
on explicit measures of danger during interaction. The level of danger
is estimated based on factors influencing the impact force during
a human-robot collision, such as the effective robot inertia, the
relative velocity and the distance between the robot and the human.
A second key requirement for improving safety is the ability of the
robot to perceive its environment, and more specifically, human behavior
and reaction to robot movements. This paper also proposes and demonstrates
the use of human monitoring information based on vision and physiological
sensors to further improve the safety of the human robot interaction.
A methodology for integrating sensor-based information about the
user's position and physiological reaction to the robot into medium
and short-term safety strategies is presented. This methodology is
verified through a series of experimental test cases where a human
and an articulated robot respond to each other based on the human's
physical and physiological behavior.},

triangle is a flexible substrate allowing the sensor to be conformed
to smooth curved surfaces. It provides 12 capacitive measurements
and it has three communications ports placed along its sides: one
for the input from an adjacent triangle, and the others as outputs
toward adjacent triangles. Each triangle is therefore a single sensor
module implementing 12 taxels. The measurements are sent to microcontroller
boards using serial bus communication links. A microcontroller board
set-up and reads the data coming from a group of modules. Every microcontroller
board has a CAN-bus link. The spatial resolution of the skin is one
sensor every 5mm. The aim of the project is to install the artificial
skin on the humanoid robot iCub, for studying control strategy using
tactile feedback coming from the whole body, but it can be used for
many other different mechatronic applications where distributed pressure
information along a surface are required},

	Abstract = {We describe a humanoid robot platform {\^A} the iCub {\^A} which was designed
to support collaborativeresearch in cognitive development through
autonomous exploration and social interaction. Themotivation for
this effort is the conviction that significantly greater impact can
be leveraged by adoptingan open systems policy for software and hardware
development. This creates the need for a robusthumanoid robot that
offers rich perceptuo-motor capabilities with many degrees of freedom,
a cognitivecapacity for learning and development, a software architecture
that encourages reuse \& easy integration,and a support infrastructure
that fosters collaboration and sharing of resources. The iCub satisfies
all ofthese needs in the guise of an open-system platform which is
freely available and which has attracted agrowing community of users
and developers. To date, twenty iCubs each comprising approximately
5000mechanical and electrical parts have been delivered to several
research labs in Europe and to one in theUSA.},

This activity is part of a general upgrade of the humanoid robot
to provide the entire 53 degree of freedom robot with low-level joint
torque control. In particular, the shoulder is challenging because
of the complex and compact mechanism of the shoulder. We first modeled
the behaviour of the sensors with analytical equations and the sensor
geometry were subsequently optimized using finite element structural
simulations. The sensors were then constructed, and integrated in
the arm assembly. Finally we present preliminary experiments to validate
the design.},

@inproceedings{Pratt1995,
	Abstract = {It is traditional to make the interface between an actuator and its
load as stiff as possible. Despite this tradition, reducing interface
stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock
tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force
control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity
for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness
also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors
propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't
everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element
within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity
instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical
spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent
in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system
for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors
conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator
meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small
planetary rover.},

@article{Rude1997,
	Abstract = {This paper handles the problem of collision avoidance in a multi-robot
environment. To solve this problem, the motion processes of the mobile
robots are modelled in space-time. Since the robots are autonomous
and communication is non-deterministic, there is temporal uncertainty
in addition to spatial uncertainty. The paper presents a method to
model both uncertainty components in a homogeneous way. It is shown,
that it is not sufficient to guarantee a spatial security distance
between the robots. Distances in space-time and space-time vectors
must be considered. The main result of this paper is a straightforward
and efficient solution to the problem of collision avoidance between
up to three mobile robots by applying a space-time displacement vector.
The solution is based on space-time, which is a helpful view onto
our world in relativity theory and quantum physics. Space-time methods
are also very valuable in Robotics, especially for problems in dynamic
environments and for motion coordination of mobile robots. Practical
experiments with up to two robots, and simulations of up to three
robots have been performed and are reported.},

	Abstract = {<P>Fundamental and technological topics are blended uniquely and developed
clearly in nine chapters - with a gradually increasing level of complexity.
A wide variety of relevant problems is raised throughout, and the
proper tools to find engineering-oriented solutions are introduced
and explained, step by step.</P> <P>Fundamental coverage includes
kinematics, statics and dynamics of manipulators, and trajectory
planning and motion control in free space.</P> <P>Technological aspects
include actuators, sensors, hardware- and software-control architectures
and industrial robot-control algorithms.</P> <P>Furthermore, established
research results involving description of end-effector orientation,
closed kinematic chains, kinematic redundancy and singularities,
dynamic parameter identification, robust and adaptive control, and
force and motion control are provided.</P> <P>To provide readers
with a homogeneous background, three appendices are included on linear
algebra, rigid-body mechanics, and feedback control.</P> <P>To impart
practical skill, more than 50 examples and case studies are carefully
worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort
to simulation. In addition, more than 80 end-of-chapter exercises
are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual containing
the MATLAB<SUP>{\^A}{\textregistered}</SUP> code for computer problems; this is available
from the publisher free of charge to those adopting this volume as
a textbook for courses.</P>},

@article{Sisbot2010,
	Abstract = {With robotics hardware becoming more and more safe and compliant,
robots are not far from entering our homes. The robot, that will
share the same environment with humans, will be expected to consider
the geometry of the interaction and to perform intelligent space
sharing. In this case, even the simplest tasks, e.g. handing over
an object to a person, raise important questions such as: where the
task should be achieved?; how to place the robot relatively to the
human in order to ease the human action?; how to hand over an object?;
and more generally, how to move in a relatively constrained environment
in the presence of humans? In this paper we present an integrated
motion synthesis framework from planning to execution that is especially
designed for a robot that interacts with humans. This framework,
composed of Perspective Placement, Human Aware Manipulation Planner
and Soft Motion Trajectory Planner, generates robot motions by taking
into account humans safety; his vision field and his perspective;
his kinematics and his posture along with the task constraints.},

@article{Yang2000,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel neural network approach to real-time collision-free
path planning of robot manipulators in a nonstationary environment
is proposed, which is based on a biologically inspired neural network
model for dynamic trajectory generation of a point mobile robot.
The state space of the proposed neural network is the joint space
of the robot manipulators, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized
by a shunting equation or an additive equation. The real-time robot
path is planned through the varying neural activity landscape that
represents the dynamic environment. The proposed model for robot
path planning with safety consideration is capable of planning a
real-time comfortable path without suffering from the too close nor
too far problems. The model algorithm is computationally efficient.
The computational complexity is linearly dependent on the neural
network size. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through
simulation studies.},
