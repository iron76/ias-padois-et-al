	Abstract = {Robots come into physical contact with humans in both experimental and operational settings. Many potential factors motivate the detection of human contact, ranging from safe robot operation around humans, to robot behaviors that depend on human guidance. This article presents a review of current research within the field of Tactile HumanRobot Interactions (Tactile HRI), where physical contact from a human is detected by a robot during the execution or development of robot behaviors. Approaches are presented from two viewpoints: the types of physical interactions that occur between the human and robot, and the types of sensors used to detect these interactions. We contribute a structure for the categorization of Tactile HRI research within each viewpoint. Tactile sensing techniques are grouped into three categories, according to what covers the sensors: (i) a hard shell, (ii) a flexible substrate or (iii) no covering. Three categories of physical HRI likewise are identified, consisting of contact that (i) interferes with robot behavior execution, (ii) contributes to behavior execution and (iii) contributes to behavior development. We populate each category with the current literature, and furthermore identify the state-of-the-art within categories and promising areas for future research.},

	Abstract = {Demonstration learning is a powerful and practical technique to develop robot behaviors. Even so, development remains a challenge and possible demonstration limitations can degrade policy performance. This work presents an approach for policy improvement and adaptation through a tactile interface located on the body of a robot. We introduce the Tactile Policy Correction (TPC) algorithm, that employs tactile feedback for the refinement of a demonstrated policy, as well as its reuse for the development of other policies. We validate TPC on a humanoid robot performing grasp-positioning tasks. The performance of the demonstrated policy is found to improve with tactile corrections. Tactile guidance also is shown to enable the development of policies able to successfully execute novel, undemonstrated, tasks.},

@article{Asai2009,
	Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to compare two different feedback controllers for the stabilization of quiet standing in humans, taking into account that the intrinsic ankle stiffness is insufficient and that there is a large delay inducing instability in the feedback loop: 1) a standard linear, continuous-time PD controller and 2) an intermittent PD controller characterized by a switching function defined in the phase plane, with or without a dead zone around the nominal equilibrium state. The stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincar\'{e} maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is off when the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is on otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains (P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements in humans.},

@article{Babic2001,
	Abstract = {The aim of the experiment reported here was to determine the static and dynamic stability of two-point stance phases when walking on hands and knees at different speeds. In addition, we defined the methods and predicted the consequences of including two-point stance phases into crutch assisted functional electrical stimulation (FES) walking. Crawling on hands and knees was performed at three speeds by five healthy male persons. With twelve joint-position markers placed on the subject, we determined two stability indices for every instant of gait. We analysed the peak values of these two indices during the two-point stance phases. The results indicate that we have to ensure the proper position of the centre of gravity to increase the speed of walking. To reach speeds, lower than 0.6 m/s, it is not necessary to include statically unstable phases. The shift of the centre of gravity towards and across the leading stability edge can result in getting into the dynamically unstable state. Considering the results we can effectively introduce two-point stance phases into crutch assisted FES walking and therefore increase the speed and energy effectiveness of walking},

	Abstract = {A new algorithm for computing contact forces between solid objects with friction is presented. The algorithm allows a mix of contact points with static and dynamic friction. In contrast to previous approaches, the problem of computing contact forces is not transformed into an optimization problem. Because of this, the need for sophisticated optimization software packages is eliminated. For both systems with and without friction, the algorithm has proven to be considerably faster, simpler, and more reliable than previous approaches to the problem. In particular, implementation of the algorithm by nonspecialists in numerical programming is quite fea- sible.},

@article{Buchli2009,
	Abstract = {Many critical elements for statically stable walking for legged robots have been known for a long time, including stability criteria based on support polygons, good foothold selection, recovery strategies to name a few. All these criteria have to be accounted for in the planning as well as the control phase. Most legged robots usually employ high gain position control, which means that it is crucially important that the planned reference trajectories are a good match for the actual terrain, and that tracking is accurate. Such an approach leads to conservative controllers, i.e. relatively low speed, ground speed matching, etc. Not surprisingly such controllers are not very robust - they are not suited for the real world use outside of the laboratory where the knowledge of the world is limited and error prone. Thus, to achieve robust robotic locomotion in the archetypical domain of legged systems, namely complex rough terrain, where the size of the obstacles are in the order of leg length, additional elements are required. A possible solution to improve the robustness of legged locomotion is to maximize the compliance of the controller. While compliance is trivially achieved by reduced feedback gains, for terrain requiring precise foot placement (e.g. climbing rocks, walking over pegs or cracks) compliance cannot be introduced at the cost of inferior tracking. Thus, model-based control and - in contrast to passive dynamic walkers - active balance control is required. To achieve these objectives, in this paper we add two crucial elements to legged locomotion, i.e., floating-base inverse dynamics control and predictive force control, and we show that these elements increase robustness in face of unknown and unanticipated perturbations (e.g. obstacles). Furthermore, we introduce a novel line-based COG trajectory planner, which yields a simpler algorithm than traditional polygon based methods and creates the appropriate input to our control system.We show results from bot- h simulation and real world of a robotic dog walking over non-perceived obstacles and rocky terrain. The results prove the effectivity of the inverse dynamics/force controller. The presented results show that we have all elements needed for robust all-terrain locomotion, which should also generalize to other legged systems, e.g., humanoid robots.},

@article{Burdet2001,
	Abstract = {To manipulate objects or to use tools we must compensate for any forces arising from interaction with the physical environment. Recent studies indicate that this compensation is achieved by learning an internal model of the dynamics, that is, a neural representation of the relation between motor command and movement. In these studies interaction with the physical environment was stable, but many common tasks are intrinsically unstable. For example, keeping a screwdriver in the slot of a screw is unstable because excessive force parallel to the slot can cause the screwdriver to slip and because misdirected force can cause loss of contact between the screwdriver and the screw. Stability may be dependent on the control of mechanical impedance in the human arm because mechanical impedance can generate forces which resist destabilizing motion. Here we examined arm movements in an unstable dynamic environment created by a robotic interface. Our results show that humans learn to stabilize unstable dynamics using the skillful and energy-efficient strategy of selective control of impedance geometry.},

	Abstract = {This paper is the second in a two part series describing a recursive, divide and conquer algorithm for calculating the forward dynamics of a robot mechanism, or a general rigid body system, on a parallel computer. This paper presents the general version of the algorithm. The derivation begins with an algorithm for kinematic trees, which is then extended to closed loop systems. The general algorithm achieves O(log(n)) time complexity on O(n) processors for all kinematic trees and a large subset of closed loop systems.This paper also presents a more accurate version of the algorithm and the results of some numerical accuracy tests that compare both versions with the standard articulated body algorithm. The tests use rigid body systems containing up to 1024 bodies, and they show that the divide and conquer algorithm is substantially less accurate than the best serial algorithm but still accurate enough to be useful.},

@article{Featherstone1999,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a recursive, divide-and-conquer algorithm for calculating the forward dynamics of a robot mechanism, or general rigid-body system, on a parallel computer. It features O(log(n)) time complexity on O(n) processors and is the fastest available algorithm for a computer with a large number of processors and low communications costs. It is an exact, noniterative algorithm and is applicable to mechanisms with any joint type and any topology, including branches and kinematic loops. The algorithm works by recursive application of a formula that constructs the articulatedbody equations of motion of an assembly from those of its constituent parts. The inputs to this formula are the equations of motion of two independent subassemblies, plus a description of how they are to be connected, and the output is the equation of motion of the assembly. Starting with a collection of unconnected rigid bodies, the equations of motion of any rigid-body system can be constructed by repeated application of this formula. This paper, being the first in a two-part series, presents an overview of the new algorithm and a detailed description of the simplest case: unbranched kinematic chains. Details of the general case are presented in Part 2.},

@article{Forner-Cordero2005,
	Abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) has not been very much in vogue within the field of movement coordination even though it is useful to reduce data dimensionality and to reveal underlying data structures. Traditionally, studies of coordination between two joints have predominantly made use of relative phase analyses. This has resulted in the identification of principal constraints that govern the Central Nervous System's organization and the control of coordination patterns. However, relative phase analyses on pairwise joints have some drawbacks because they are not optimal for revealing convergent patterns among multijoint coordination modes and for unraveling generic control strategies. In this paper, we present a method to analyze multijoint coordination based on the properties of PC, more specifically the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The comparison between relative phase analysis and PCA shows that both provide similar and consistent results, underscoring the latter technique's sensitivity to the study of coordination performance. In addition, it provides a method for automatic pattern detection as well as an index of performance for each joint within the context of the global coordination pattern. Finally, the merit of the PCA technique within the context of central pattern generators (CPG) will be discussed.},

@article{Gillette2005,
	Abstract = {Sit-to-stand movements are a fundamental daily activity and a prerequisite to upright posture. Previous simulations of spinal cord injured individuals using functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) suggested a forward foot placement would reduce hand-support forces. However, this recommendation has proved to be difficult for able-bodied individuals standing hands-free and for individuals with spinal cord injuries standing with a walker. This inverse model is a step towards the goal of using forward simulations to determine efficient sit-to-stand strategies. Initial seated postures varied from 80-110 degrees of knee flexion and 90-120 degrees of hip flexion. Realistic progressions of lower extremity joint angles including development of linear momentum were created using sigmoid functions. These kinematic values were used to estimate the required resultant joint torques to complete sit-to-stand. Joint torque values that act to raise the body were combined to indicate sit-to-stand difficulty from different seated postures. A representative foot-forward placement (knee 80 degrees, hip 90 degrees) resulted in a maximum combined torque of 544 Nm. In contrast, a representative foot-back placement (knee 110 degrees, hip 120 degrees) resulted in a maximum combined torque of 661 Nm. An intermediate seated posture (knee 97 degrees, hip 90 degrees) produced the lowest maximum combined torque of 401 Nm (2 Nm ankle plantarflexion, 201 Nm knee extension, 198 Nm hip extension). Foot-forward placement required substantial ankle dorsiflexion torques. The most efficient strategy appeared to be combining a foot back placement with momentum generation using hip flexion. By generalizing the sit-to-stand model beyond FNS-driven movements, further insight may be gained into other populations (i.e., elderly).},

Robots equipped with appropriate sensors can sense the touch. In this paper, we present how an unskilled user can intuitively teach the lightweight robot at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), We\&amp;szlig;ling, Germany, just by touching the arm. Programming by "touch" is very intuitive as you take the robot by the hand and demonstrate the movements. This feature can also be used to interact with the service robot while executing a task. Therefore, if our seven-degrees-of-freedom robot arm senses a touch, it will react by an evasive motion of the touched links while keeping the orientation of the tool center point.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses the pushing manipulation of an object by a humanoid robot. For such a pushing task, we show that there are two kinds of ZMPs, i.e., the conventional "Zero Moment Point (ZMP)" considering all sources of the force/moment acting in the foot supporting area, and the "Generalized Zero Moment Point (GZMP)" which is an generalization of ZMP for a humanoid robot whose hands do not contact with an object. We first obtain the stable region of the GZMP on the floor. Moreover, since the difference between these two ZMPs corresponds to the magnitude of contact force applied by the hands, we propose the pushing manipulation by a humanoid robot by modifying the desired ZMP trajectory for a humanoid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation results.},

If the object is heavy, the humanoid robot pushes it by walking slowly and vice versa.

The planner allows contact with any pre-designated part of the robots body, since the use of hands or knees (in addition to feet) may be required to balance. It uses a probabilistic, sample-based approach to compute each step. One challenge of this approach is that most randomly sampled configurations do not satisfy all motion constraints (closed-chain, equilibrium, collision). To address this problem, a method of iterative constraint enforce- ment is presented that samples feasible configurations much more quickly.

@article{Huang2011,
	Abstract = {Background: Understanding how stability and/or maneuverability affects motor control strategies can provide insight on moving about safely in an unpredictable world. Stability in human movement has been well-studied while maneuverability has not. Further, a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during movement seems apparent, yet has not been quantified. We proposed that greater maneuverability, the ability to rapidly and purposefully change movement direction and speed, is beneficial in uncertain environments. We also hypothesized that gaining maneuverability comes at the expense of stability and perhaps also corresponds with decreased muscle coactivation. Materials and Methods: We used a goal-directed forward lean movement task that integrated both stability and maneuverability. Subjects (n=11) used their center of pressure to control a cursor on a computer monitor to reach a target. We added task uncertainty by shifting the target anterior-posterior position mid-movement. We used a balance board with a narrow beam that reduced the base of support in the medio-lateral direction and defined stability as the probability that subjects could keep the balance board level during the task. Results: During the uncertainty condition, subjects were able to change direction of their anterior-posterior center of pressure more rapidly, indicating that subjects were more maneuverable. Furthermore, medio-lateral center of pressure excursions also approached the edges of the beam and reduced stability margins, implying that subjects were less stable (i.e. less able to keep the board level). On the narrow beam board, subjects increased muscle coactivation of lateral muscle pairs and had greater muscle activity in the left leg. However, there were no statistically significant differences in muscle activity amplitudes or coactivation with uncertainty. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during a goal-directed whole-body movement. Tasks with added uncertainty could help individuals learn to be more maneuverable yet sufficiently stable.},

Adaptation to uneven ground is achieved by optimally distributed antigravitational forces applied to preset contact points in a feedforward manner, even without explicitly measuring the external forces or the terrain shape. Adaptation to unknown inclination is also possible by combining an active balancing controller based on the center-of-mass (CoM) measurements with respect to the inertial frame. Furthermore, we show that a simple impedance controller for supporting the feet or hands allows the robot to adapt to low-friction ground without prior knowledge of the ground friction.

	Abstract = {The authors have developed a robot called "Robovie" that has unique mechanisms designed for communication with humans. Robovie can generate human-like behaviors by using human-like actuators and vision and audio sensors. Software is a key element in the systems development. Two important ideas in human-robot communication through research from the viewpoint of cognitive science have been obtained - one is importance of physical expressions using the body and the other is the effectiveness of the robot's autonomy in the robot's utterance recognition by humans. Based on these psychological experiments, a new architecture that generates episode chains in interactions with humans is developed. The basic structure of the architecture is a network of situated modules. Each module consists of elemental behaviors to entrain humans and a behavior for communicating with humans.},

	Abstract = {Sway is reduced by light nonsupporting touch between parts of the body and a fixed surface. This effect is assumed to reflect augmentation of sensory cues for sway by point-of-contact reaction forces. It has been shown that movement of the contact surface can increase sway relative to an earth-fixed contact. Light touch contact with another person, for example, holding hands, affords a moving contact due to partner sway. We asked whether interpersonal light touch (IPLT) would increase sway relative to standing alone. We expected effects on sway to vary as a function of the site of contact and the postural stability of each partner. Eight pairs of participants, standing in either normal bipedal or tandem Romberg stance with eyes closed and using IPLT (finger to finger or shoulder to shoulder) or no contact, provided 4 trials of 30-s duration in each of 12 posture-touch combinations. Sway (SD of the rate of change of upper trunk position at C7) was reliably less with IPLT compared with no contact, with two exceptions: in normal stance, shoulder contact with a partner in tandem stance, and in tandem Romberg stance, finger contact with a partner in the same stance, increased sway. Otherwise, the reduction in sway was greater with shoulder than with finger contact. Measures of interpersonal synchronization based on cross-correlations and coherence analysis between the partners' C7 movements suggest different control factors operate to reduce sway in IPLT with the hand or shoulder contact.},

	Abstract = {Many motor skills in humanoid robotics can be learned using parametrized motor primitives. While successful applications to date have been achieved with imitation learning, most of the interesting motor learning problems are high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems. These problems are often beyond the reach of current reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we study parametrized policy search methods and apply these to benchmark problems of motor primitive learning in robotics. We show that many well-known parametrized policy search methods can be derived from a general, common framework. This framework yields both policy gradient methods and expectation-maximization (EM) inspired algorithms. We introduce a novel EM-inspired algorithm for policy learning that is particularly well-suited for dynamical system motor primitives. We compare this algorithm, both in simulation and on a real robot, to several well-known parametrized policy search methods such as episodic REINFORCE, 'Vanilla' Policy Gradients with optimal baselines, episodic Natural Actor Critic, and episodic Reward-Weighted Regression. We show that the proposed method out-performs them on an empirical benchmark of learning dynamical system motor primitives both in simulation and on a real robot. We apply it in the context of motor learning and show that it can learn a complex Ball-in-a-Cup task on a real Barrett WAM robot arm.},

Next one introduces a basic formula for controlling stiffness of the joint as well as its angles using multiple ANLESes. It follows the evaluation of the proposed formula by the simulation analysis. Three DOF joint manipulated by six or eight tendons that are individually controlled by the ANLES is evaluated with respect to the stiffness control.},

@article{Krishnamoorthy2004,
	Abstract = {Muscle synergies in postural tasks have recently been studied using the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis. A set of three hypothetical control variables, named M-modes, derived from the activity of 11 postural muscles, were identified. It was shown that postural synergies composed of these three M-modes preserve a certain shift of the center of pressure (COP) when subjects perform postural tasks while standing on a stable surface. In the present study we investigated the effects of support surface instability and availability of a light touch or grasp of a stable external support on the M-modes and their co-variation. The study was performed in two sessions. In the first session subjects released a load behind the body under four conditions: standing on a stable surface with no support (ST), standing on an unstable surface with no support (UN), standing on an unstable surface with a light touch (UN,T) and standing on an unstable surface with grasp of a stable object (UN,G). In the second session subjects performed two tasks: an arm movement backward and voluntary sway forward (towards the toes) under three conditions-ST, UN and UN,T. Principal component analysis was used to identify M-modes from data in the first session, and a UCM analysis was performed to study M-mode synergies in postural stabilization from data in the second session. A 'menu' of five M-modes was found, which were named either reciprocal M-modes or co-contraction M-modes based on the agonist-antagonist relationship of muscles comprising each mode. For a given task, subjects chose any three of these five M-modes in a subject- and task-specific manner. The reciprocal and co-contraction M-modes occurred equally frequently whether subjects stood on a stable or unstable support surface or whether a light touch was available or not. However, the co-contraction M-modes predominated when grasp of an object was available. In this condition, when the arm could be used for stabilization, there were M-modes uniting hip and shoulder muscles. However, the identified M-mode synergies were not found to lead to a consistent shift in the COP in any of the stability conditions. Possible reasons for this finding are discussed.},

Using an optoelectronic movement analyzer, the smallest compressed angles of the hip and ankle were measured during standing up and sitting down. The adopted strategies had significant effects on the smallest hip-compressed angle, but not the smallest ankle-compressed angle. Although cane use led to a larger trunk angular displacement than did chair-arm use, a cane can provide help during the whole transfer process.

	Abstract = {Biological systems are able to perform movements in unpredictable environments more elegantly than traditionally engineered robotic systems. A current limitation of robotic systems is their inability to simultaneously and independently control both joint angle and joint stiffness without electromechanical feedback loops, which can reduce system stability. In this paper, we describe the development and physical implementation of a servo-actuated robotic joint that uses antagonistic, series-elastic actuation with novel nonlinear spring mechanisms. These mechanisms form a real-time mechanical feedback loop that provides the joint with angle and stiffness control through differential and common-mode actuation of the servos, respectively. This approach to joint control emulates the mechanics of antagonistic muscle groups used by animals, and we experimentally show that it is capable of independently controlling both joint angle and joint stiffness using a simple open-loop control algorithm.},

The Socio-SI group has focused on the design principles of communicative and intelligent machines and human social development through building a humanoid robot that has physical and perceptual structures close to us, that enables safe and close interactions with humans. For this purpose, CB2 was designed, especially in order to establish and maintain a long-term social interaction between human and robot. The most significant features of CB2 are a whole-body soft skin (silicon surface with many tactile sensors underneath) and flexible joints (51 pneumatic actuators).

	Abstract = {Model-based control methods can be used to enable fast, dexterous, and compliant motion of robots without sacrificing control accuracy. However, implementing such techniques on floating base robots, e.g., humanoids and legged systems, is non-trivial due to under-actuation, dynamically changing constraints from the environment, and potentially closed loop kinematics. In this paper, we show how to compute the analytically correct inverse dynamics torques for model-based control of sufficiently constrained floating base rigid-body systems, such as humanoid robots with one or two feet in contact with the environment. While our previous inverse dynamics approach relied on an estimation of contact forces to compute an approximate inverse dynamics solution, here we present an analytically correct solution by using an orthogonal decomposition to project the robot dynamics onto a reduced dimensional space, independent of contact forces. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our approach on a simulated floating base bipedal humanoid robot and an actual robot dog locomoting over rough terrain.},

First we recorded demonstrations of sit-to-stand motions from normal human subjects as well as actors performing stylized standing motions (e.g. imitating an elderly person). Ground contact force information was also collected for these motions, in order to estimate the humans center of mass trajectory. We then mapped the demonstrated motions to the humanoid robot via an inverse kinematics procedure that attempts to track the humans kinematics as well as their center-of-mass trajectory. In order to estimate the robots center-of-mass position accu- rately, we additionally used an inertial parameter identification technique that fitmass and center-of-mass link parameters from measured force data.

The estimation of inertial parameters from data is a critical component for obtaining accurate models for control. However, floating base systems, such as humanoid robots, incur added challenges to this task (e.g. contact forces must be measured, contact states can change, etc.) In this work, we outline a theoretical framework for whole body inertial parameter estimation, including the unactuated floating base. Using a least squares minimization approach, conducted within the null-space of unmeasured degrees of freedom, we are able to use a partial force sensor set for full-body estimation, e.g. using only joint torque sensors, allowing for estimation when contact force measurement is unavailable or unreliable (e.g. due to slipping, rolling contacts, etc.). We also propose how to determine the theoretical minimum force sensor set for full body estimation, and discuss the practical limitations of doing so.},

	Abstract = {One of the most general frameworks for phrasing control problems for complex, redundant robots is operational-space control. However, while this framework is of essential importance for robotics and well understood from an analytical point of view, it can be prohibitively hard to achieve accurate control in the face of modeling errors, which are inevitable in complex robots (e.g. humanoid robots). In this paper, we suggest a learning approach for operational-space control as a direct inverse model learning problem. A first important insight for this paper is that a physically correct solution to the inverse problem with redundant degrees of freedom does exist when learning of the inverse map is performed in a suitable piecewise linear way. The second crucial component of our work is based on the insight that many operational-space controllers can be understood in terms of a constrained optimal control problem. The cost function associated with this optimal control problem allows us to formulate a learning algorithm that automatically synthesizes a globally consistent desired resolution of redundancy while learning the operational-space controller. From the machine learning point of view, this learning problem corresponds to a reinforcement learning problem that maximizes an immediate reward. We employ an expectation-maximization policy search algorithm in order to solve this problem. Evaluations on a three degrees-of-freedom robot arm are used to illustrate the suggested approach. The application to a physically realistic simulator of the anthropomorphic SARCOS Master arm demonstrates feasibility for complex high degree-of-freedom robots. We also show that the proposed method works in the setting of learning resolved motion rate control on a real, physical Mitsubishi PA-10 medical robotics arm.},

	Abstract = {Learning robots that can acquire new motor skills and refine existing one has been a long standing vision of robotics, artificial intelligence, and the cognitive sciences. Early steps towards this goal in the 1980s made clear that reasoning and human insights will not suffice. Instead, new hope has been offered by the rise of modern machine learning approaches. However, to date, it becomes increasingly clear that off-the-shelf machine learning approaches will not suffice for motor skill learning as these methods often do not scale into the high-dimensional domains of manipulator and humanoid robotics nor do they fulfill the real-time requirement of our domain. As an alternative, we propose to break the generic skill learning problem into parts that we can understand well from a robotics point of view. After designing appropriate learning approaches for these basic components, these will serve as the ingredients of a general approach to motor skill learning. In this paper, we discuss our recent and current pro gress in this direction. For doing so, we present our work on learning to control, on learning elementary movements as well as our steps towards learning of complex tasks. We show several evaluations both using real robots as well as physically realistic simulations.},

However there are many benefits to utilizing contact along the entire length of robot body and links especially for human-like robots. Existing control strategies for link contact require knowledge of the contact point. In an uncertain environment, locating link contact point is difficult for most robots as they do not possess skin capable of sensing. We propose a probabilistic approach to link contact estimation based on geometric considerations and compliant motions. Since for many robots, link geometry is also uncertain, we broaden our approach to simultaneously estimate link shape and environment contact. Our experimental results demonstrate that efficiency of control is significantly improved by link contact estimation},

	Abstract = {Inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers have proved to be very efficient for compliant control of fully actuated robots such as fixed base manipulators. However legged robots such as humanoids are inherently different as they are underactuated and subject to switching external contact constraints. Recently several methods have been proposed to create inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers for these robots. In an attempt to compare these different approaches, we develop a general framework for inverse dynamics control and show that these methods lead to very similar controllers. We are then able to greatly simplify recent whole-body controllers based on operational space approaches using kinematic projections, bringing them closer to efficient practical implementations. We also generalize these controllers such that they can be optimal under an arbitrary quadratic cost in the commands.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for modular motor control based on a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formulation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic control policies. Model-based control theory is used to convert the outputs of these policies into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, on-line modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstration. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB, and learning biped walking from demonstration in simulation, including self-improvement of the movement patterns towards energy efficiency through resonance tuning.},

By implication, other degrees of freedom are not controlled. We give an operational meaning to "controlled" and "uncontrolled" and describe a method of analysis through which hypotheses about controlled and uncontrolled degrees of freedom can be tested. In this conception, control refers to stabilization, so that lack of control implies reduced stability. The method was used to analyze an experiment on the sit-to-stand transition. By testing different hypotheses about the controlled variables, we systematically approximated the structure of control in joint space. We found that, for the task of sit-to-stand, the position of the center of mass in the sagittal plane was controlled. The horizontal head position and the position of the hand were controlled less stably, while vertical head position appears to be no more controlled than joint motions.},

The approach leverages the virtual-linkage model that provides a physical representation of the internal and CoM resultant forces with respect to reaction forces on the supporting surfaces. A grasp/contact matrix describing the complex interactions between contact forces and CoM behavior is developed. Based on this model, a new torque-based approach for the control of internal forces is suggested and illustrated on the Asimo humanoid robot. The new controller is integrated into the framework for whole-body-prioritized multitasking, thus enabling the unified control of CoM maneuvers, operational tasks, and internal-force behavior. The grasp/contact matrix is also proposed to analyze and plan internal force and CoM control policies that comply with frictional properties of the links in contact.},

@article{Shadmehr1994a,
	Abstract = {We investigated how the CNS learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the role of additional perceptual information (finger touch) and additional mechanical support (hand grasp) on the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) associated with fast arm movements performed by standing subjects. The subjects performed fast, unilateral shoulder ante-flexion movements while standing on a stable force platform or on an unstable board with instability in a sagittal or in a frontal plane. Changes in the background activity of leg, trunk, and arm muscles and displacements of the center of pressure were quantified within time intervals typical for APAs. Leg and trunk muscles showed a significant drop in APAs with added finger touch and no further changes when the touch was substituted with hand grasp. Arm muscles showed no changes or a small drop in APAs with touch and a significant increase in APAs with grasp. These changes were seen during both stable and unstable standing. We conclude that APAs can show changes associated not only with mechanical aspects of a task, but also with its perceptual aspects. Based on the equilibrium-point hypothesis of motor control, an additional analysis of APAs was performed. With additional support, we observed a significant modulation of an index related to the co-activation of agonist-antagonist muscle pairs, while no changes in reciprocal activation were found. A similar analysis performed across all the leg and trunk muscles with respect to control of the center of mass lead to similar results. We conclude that the central nervous system seems to simplify adjustments of control patterns to changes in task parameters by modulation of only one of the two major central commands.},

In our Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA) approach, actuators control in real-time both the reference position and the mechanical impedance of the moving parts in the machine in such a way to optimize performance while intrinsically guaranteeing safety. In this paper we describe an implementation of such concepts, consisting of a novel electromechanical Variable Stiffness Actuation (VSA) motor. The design and the functioning principle of the VSA are reported, along with the analysis of its dynamic behavior. A novel scheme for feedback control of this device is presented, along with experimental results showing performance and safety of a one-link arm actuated by the VSA motor.},

In order to investigate the psychological and social effects of the robots, each subject was interviewed by using the free pile sort method, and their subjective social network was analysed. In addition, the activities of the residents in public areas were recorded by video cameras during daytime hours (8:30-18:00) for over 2 months. Then, their social network was analysed from the video data objectively. The results showed that the density of the social networks was increased through interaction with the robots subjectively and objectively.},

Strictly derived from the minimization of instability, motion error, and effort, the controller compensates for the disturbance in the environment in interaction tasks by adapting feedforward force and impedance. In contrast with conventional learning controllers, the new controller can deal with unstable situations that are typical of tool use and gradually acquire a desired stabilitymargin. Simulations showthat this controller is a good model ofhumanmotor adaptation.Robotic implementations further demonstrate its capabilities to optimally adapt interactionwith dynamic environments and humans in joint torque controlled robots and variable impedance actuators, with- out requiring interaction force sensing.},

	Abstract = {This paper details the implementation of state-of-the-art whole-body control algorithms on the humanoid robot iCub. We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

	Abstract = {This review is the result of a joint reflection carried out by researchers in the fields of robotics and automatic control on the one hand and neuroscience on the other, both trying to answer the same question: what are the functional bases of bipedal locomotion and how can they be controlled? The originality of this work is to synthesize the two approaches in order to take advantage of the knowledge concerning the adaptability and reactivity performances of humans and of the rich tools and formal concepts available in biped robotics. Indeed, we claim that the theoretical framework of robotics can enhance our understanding of human postural control by formally expressing the experimental concepts used in neuroscience. Conversely, biological knowledge of human posture and gait can inspire biped robot design and control. Therefore, both neuroscientists and roboticists should find useful information in this paper.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide information on the advantages and possible disadvantages of using canes and walkers. DATA SOURCES: English-language articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and PubMed (1966-May 2003) for key words cane or walker , excluding articles unrelated to mobility aids. Bibliographies were reviewed and ISI Web of Science citation searches were run to identify additional references. Over 1000 articles were selected for further evaluation. STUDY SELECTION: We extracted all studies of single-tip canes or pickup walkers addressing: (1) functional, biomechanic, or neuromotor benefits; (2) biomechanic, attentional, neuromotor, metabolic, or physiologic demands; and (3) falls, injuries, or other problems. We included approximately 10\% of the articles originally identified. DATA EXTRACTION: The methodology of each selected article, and findings relevant to the benefits, demands, or adverse effects of cane or walker use were summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: Findings were synthesized by considering their relation to basic biomechanic principles. Some biomechanic findings appear to support the clinical view that canes and walkers can improve balance and mobility for older adults and people with other clinical conditions. However, a large proportion of users experience difficulties, and the use of such devices is associated with increased risk of falling. A small number of studies have characterized some of the specific demands and problems associated with using mobility aids. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and biomechanic evaluations of canes and walkers confirm that these devices can improve balance and mobility. However, they can also interfere with ones ability to maintain balance in certain situations, and the strength and metabolic demands can be excessive. More research is needed to identify and solve specific problems. Such research may lead to improved designs and guidelines for safer use of canes and walkers.},

	Abstract = {Perturbation of whole-body stability often evokes rapid arm reactions. It has been suggested that the earliest arm activation is a generic (e.g. startle-like) response to which a later stabilizing (e.g. counterweight or reach-to-grasp) or impact-protection component can be appended. To examine whether the initial part of the reaction is generic, we examined arm reactions evoked by small balance perturbations in 12 healthy young adults while varying perturbation direction (rightward or forward platform translation) and environmental conditions (handrail present or absent). The perturbation magnitude was selected to be sufficiently small to obviate the need to use the arms for stabilization. To avoid adaptation or habituation, analysis focused on each subject's very first exposure to the perturbation. Most subjects exhibited active movement of both arms in reaction to the perturbation, but there was large (non-stereotypical) inter-subject variation in muscle-onset latency and arm kinematics. Furthermore, the velocity and direction of the initial arm movement were affected by perturbation direction, in a manner consistent with functional strategies (counterweight strategy in backward falls, hybrid counterweight/protective strategy in leftward falls). Although subjects never contacted the handrail, responses were slower when it was present. These results are not consistent with a generic stereotyped response, but suggest instead that even the earliest component of first-trial arm reactions was functionally modulated.},

@article{Dimitrova2004,
	Abstract = {The postural adaptation impairments of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suggest that the basal ganglia may be important for quickly modifying muscle activation patterns when the direction of perturbation or stance conditions suddenly change. It is unknown whether their particular instability to backward postural perturbations is due to specific abnormalities of parkinsonian postural muscle synergies in that direction and not present in other directions. In the present study, we test this hypothesis by comparing the patterns of leg and trunk muscle activation in 13 subjects with PD and 13 control subjects in response to eight randomly presented directions of horizontal surface translations while standing with either narrow or wide stance. The direction of maximum activation for each muscle was similar for PD and control subjects, suggesting that the basal ganglia is not critical for programming externally triggered postural synergies. However, antagonist muscle activation was earlier and larger in PD than in control subjects, resulting in coactivation. PD subjects also did not increase the magnitude of muscle activation as much as did control subjects when changing from wide to narrow stance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PD results in an inability to shape the pattern and magnitude of postural muscle responses for changes in perturbation direction and in stance position.},

@article{Henry1998,
	Abstract = {To characterize muscle synergy organization underlying multidirectional control of stance posture, electromyographic activity was recorded from 11 lower limb and trunk muscles of 7 healthy subjects while they were subjected to horizontal surface translations in 12 different, randomly presented directions. The latency and amplitude of muscle responses were quantified for each perturbation direction. Tuning curves for each muscle were examined to relate the amplitude of the muscle response to the direction of surface translation. The latencies of responses for the shank and thigh muscles were constant, regardless of perturbation direction. In contrast, the latencies for another thigh [tensor fascia latae (TFL)] and two trunk muscles [rectus abdominis (RAB) and erector spinae (ESP)] were either early or late, depending on the perturbation direction. These three muscles with direction-specific latencies may play different roles in postural control as prime movers or as stabilizers for different translation directions, depending on the timing of recruitment. Most muscle tuning curves were within one quadrant, having one direction of maximal activity, generally in response to diagonal surface translations. Two trunk muscles (RAB and ESP) and two lower limb muscles (semimembranosus and peroneus longus) had bipolar tuning curves, with two different directions of maximal activity, suggesting that these muscle can play different roles as part of different synergies, depending on translation direction. Muscle tuning curves tended to group into one of three regions in response to 12 different directions of perturbations. Two muscles [rectus femoris (RFM) and TFL] were maximally active in response to lateral surface translations. The remaining muscles clustered into one of two diagonal regions. The diagonal regions corresponded to the two primary directions of active horizontal force vector responses. Two muscles (RFM and adductor longus) were maximally active orthogonal to their predicted direction of maximal activity based on anatomic orientation. Some of the muscles in each of the synergic regions were not anatomic synergists, suggesting a complex central organization for recruitment of muscles. The results suggest that neither a simple reflex mechanism nor a fixed muscle synergy organization is adequate to explain the muscle activation patterns observed in this postural control task. Our results are consistent with a centrally mediated pattern of muscle latencies combined with peripheral influence on muscle magnitude. We suggest that a flexible continuum of muscle synergies that are modifiable in a task-dependent manner be used for equilibrium control in stance.},

@article{Horak1986,
	Abstract = {We studied the extent to which automatic postural actions in standing human subjects are organized by a limited repertoire of central motor programs. Subjects stood on support surfaces of various lengths, which forced them to adopt different postural movement strategies to compensate for the same external perturbations. We assessed whether a continuum or a limited set of muscle activation patterns was used to produce different movement patterns and the extent to which movement patterns were influenced by prior experience. Exposing subjects standing on a normal support surface to brief forward and backward horizontal surface perturbations elicited relatively stereotyped patterns of leg and trunk muscle activation with 73- to 110-ms latencies. Activity began in the ankle joint muscles and then radiated in sequence to thigh and then trunk muscles on the same dorsal or ventral aspect of the body. This activation pattern exerted compensatory torques about the ankle joints, which restored equilibrium by moving the body center of mass forward or backward. This pattern has been termed the ankle strategy because it restores equilibrium by moving the body primarily around the ankle joints. To successfully maintain balance while standing on a support surface short in relation to foot length, subjects activated leg and trunk muscles at similar latencies but organized the activity differently. The trunk and thigh muscles antagonistic to those used in the ankle strategy were activated in the opposite proximal-to-distal sequence, whereas the ankle muscles were generally unresponsive. This activation pattern produced a compensatory horizontal shear force against the support surface but little, if any, ankle torque. This pattern has been termed the hip strategy, because the resulting motion is focused primarily about the hip joints. Exposing subjects to horizontal surface perturbations while standing on support surfaces intermediate in length between the shortest and longest elicited more complex postural movements and associated muscle activation patterns that resembled ankle and hip strategies combined in different temporal relations. These complex postural movements were executed with combinations of torque and horizontal shear forces and motions of ankle and hip joints. During the first 5-20 practice trials immediately following changes from one support surface length to another, response latencies were unchanged. The activation patterns, however, were complex and resembled the patterns observed during well-practiced stance on surfaces of intermediate lengths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Maki1997,
	Abstract = {Change-in-support strategies, involving stepping or grasping movements of the limbs, are prevalent reactions to instability and appear to play a more important functional role in maintaining upright stance than has generally been appreciated. Contrary to traditional views, change-in-support reactions are not just strategies of last resort, but are often initiated well before the center of mass is near the stability limits of the base of support. Furthermore, it appears that subjects, when given the option, will select these reactions in preference to the fixed-support "hip strategy" that has been purported to be of functional importance. The rapid speed of compensatory change-in-support reactions distinguishes them from "volitional" arm and leg movements. In addition, compensatory stepping reactions often lack the anticipatory control elements that are invariably present in non-compensatory stepping, such as gait initiation. Even when present, these anticipatory adjustments appear to have little functional value during rapid compensatory movements. Lateral destabilization complicates the control of compensatory stepping, a finding that may be particularly relevant to the problem of falls and hip fractures in elderly people. Older adults appear to have problems in controlling lateral stability when stepping to recover balance, even when responding to anteroposterior perturbation. Increased understanding and awareness of change-in-support reactions should lead to development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for detecting and treating specific causes of imbalance and falling in elderly people and in patients with balance impairments.},

We measured muscle activity at the shoulder, and the lower leg, during unconstrained responses to platform translation. Results revealed very early activation in shoulder muscles, similar in timing to the 'automatic' ankle responses. The arm activation occurred even when the reaction provided no immediate defence against destabilization but would appear to be more than a 'startle' response, since the activation was scaled to the perturbation magnitude and persisted even when perturbations were expected. The arm activation would appear to be driven from a remote sensory source, since there was negligible loading or stretch of the arm muscles.},

	Abstract = {We model human postural control of upright stance during external disturbances and voluntary lean. Our focus is on how data from various sensors are combined to estimate these disturbances. Whereas most current engineering models of multisensory estimation rely on "internal observers" and complex processing, we compute our estimates by simple sensor fusion mechanisms, i.e., weighted sums of sensory signals combined with thresholds. We show with simulations that this simple device mimics human-like postural behavior in a wide range of situations and diseases. We have now embodied our mechanism in a biped humanoid robot to show that it works in the real world with complex, noisy, and imperfectly known sensors and effectors. On the other hand, we find that the more complex, internal-observer approach, when applied to bipedal posture, can also yield human-like behavior. We suggest that humans use both mechanisms: simple, fast sensor fusions with thresholding for automatic reactions (default mechanism), and more complex methods for voluntary movements. We suggest also that the fusion with thresholding mechanisms are optimized during phylogenesis but are mainly hardwired in any one organism, whereas sensorimotor learning and optimization is mainly a domain of the internal observers.},

	Abstract = {Oscillatory motions can cause injury in transport when standing passengers or crew lose balance and fall. To predict the loss of balance of standing people, a model is required of the relationship between the input motion and the stability of the human body. This experimental study investigated the effect of frequency, magnitude and direction of oscillation on the postural stability of standing subjects and whether response to rotational oscillation can be predicted from knowledge of response to translational oscillation. Twelve male subjects stood on a floor that oscillated in either horizontal (fore-and-aft or lateral) or rotational (pitch or roll) directions. The oscillations were one-third octave bands of random motion centred on five preferred octave centre frequencies (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0Hz). The horizontal motions were presented at each of four velocities (0.04, 0.062, 0.099, and 0.16ms−1 rms) and the rotational motions were presented at each of four rotational angles (0.73, 1.46, 2.92, and 5.85$\,^{\circ}$rms) corresponding to four accelerations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0ms−2 rms), where the acceleration is that caused by rotation through the gravitational vector. Postural stability was determined by subjective methods and by measuring the displacement of the centre of pressure at the feet during horizontal oscillation. During horizontal oscillation, increases in motion magnitude increased instability and, with the same velocity at all frequencies from 0.125 to 2.0Hz, most instability occurred in the region of 0.5Hz. Fore-and-aft oscillation produced more instability than lateral oscillation, although displacements of the centre of pressure were similar in both directions. With the same angular displacement at all frequencies from 0.125 to 2.0Hz, pitch oscillation caused more instability than roll oscillation, but in both directions instability increased with increased frequency of oscillation. Frequency weightings for acceleration in the plane of the floor during translational and rotational excitation show the significance of low-frequency translational oscillation and high-frequency rotational motion, and show that it is necessary to know whether the measured acceleration is caused by translation or rotation through gravity.},

We conducted experiments that simulated vehicle starts, to examine how handrail location (overhead or shoulder-height), perturbation direction (forward, backward, left or right), and perturbation magnitude (1 or 2m/s(2)) affected the biomechanical effort (peak centre-of-pressure (COP) excursion and hand force) and muscle activations (onset and integrated EMG activity) involved in balance maintenance. COP excursions, hand forces and muscle activations were altered in a functional manner based on task constraints and perturbation characteristics. Handrail position affected normalized values of peak COP and hand force during forward and backward, but not sideways perturbations. During backward perturbations, COP excursion was greater when grasping overhead than shoulder-height. During forward perturbations, hand force was greater when grasping shoulder-height than overhead. Biceps activations were earlier during shoulder-height than overhead grasping, while tibialis anterior activity was higher during overhead than shoulder-height grasping. Our results indicate that, when facing forward or backward to the direction of vehicle motion, overhead grasping minimizes hand force, while shoulder-height grasping minimizes COP excursion. In contrast, grasping with a sideways stance eliminates the effect of handrail location, and was associated with equal or lower biomechanical effort. This suggests that, at least for vehicle starts, the most reasonable strategy may be to stand sideways to the direction of the vehicle movement, and grasp either at shoulder-height or overhead.},

@article{Wing2011,
	Abstract = {Sensory information about body sway is used to drive corrective muscle action to keep the body's centre of mass located over the base of support provided by the feet. Loss of vision, by closing the eyes, usually results in increased sway as indexed by fluctuations (i.e. standard deviation, s.d.) in the velocity of a marker at C7 on the neck, s.d. dC7. Variability in the rate of change of centre of pressure (s.d. dCoP), which indexes corrective muscle action, also increases during upright standing with eyes closed. Light touch contact by the tip of one finger with an environmental surface can reduce s.d. dC7 and s.d. dCoP as effectively as opening the eyes. We review studies of light touch and balance and then describe a novel paradigm for studying the nature of somatosensory information contributing to effects of light touch balance. We show that 'light tight touch' contact by the index finger held in the thimble of a haptic device results in increased anteroposterior (AP) sway with entraining by either simple or complex AP sinusoidal oscillations of the haptic device. Moreover, sway is also increased when the haptic device plays back the pre-recorded AP sway path of another person. Cross-correlations between hand and C7 motion reveal a 176 ms lead for the hand and we conclude that light tight touch affords an efficient route for somatosensory feedback support for balance. Furthermore, we suggest that the paradigm has potential to contribute to the understanding of interpersonal postural coordination with light touch in future research.},

@article{Winter1995,
	Abstract = {The common denominator in the assessment of human balance and posture is the inverted pendulum model. If we focus on appropriate versions of the model we can use it to identify the gravitational and acceleration perturbations and pinpoint the motor mechanisms that can defend against any perturbation. We saw that in quiet standing an ankle strategy applies only in the direction and that a separate hip load/unload strategy by the hip abd/adductors is the totally dominant defence in the direction when standing with feet side by side. In other standing positions (tandem, or intermediate) the two mechanisms still work separately, but their roles reverse. In the tandem position balance is an ankle mechanism (invertors/evertors) while in the direction a hip load/unloading mechanism dominates. During initiation and termination of gait these two separate mechanisms control the trajectory of the COP to ensure the desired acceleration and deceleration of the COM. During initiation the initial acceleration of the COM forward towards the stance limb is achieved by a posterior and lateral movement of the COP towards the swing limb. After this release phase there is a sudden loading of the stance limb which shifts the COP to the stance limb. The COM is now accelerated forward and laterally towards the future position of the swinging foot. Also shifts of the COP were controlled by the hip abductors/adductors and all shifts were under the control of the ankle plantar/dorsiflexors. During termination the trajectory of both COM and COP reverse. As the final weight-bearing on the stance foot takes place the COM is passing forward along the medial border of that foot. Hyperactivity of that foot's plantarflexors takes the COP forward and when the final foot begins to bear weight the COP moves rapidly across and suddenly stops at a position ahead of the future position of the COM. Then the plantarflexors of both feet release and allow the COP to move posteriorly and approach the COM and meet it as quiet stance is achieved. The inverted pendulum model permitted us to understand the separate roles of the two mechanisms during these critical unbalancing and rebalancing periods. During walking the inverted pendulum model explained the dynamics of the balance of HAT in both the and directions. Here the model includes the couple due to the acceleration of the weight-bearing hip as well as gravitational perturbations. The exclusive control of balance and posture are the hip extensors and flexors, while in the direction the dominant control is with the hip abductors with very minor adductor involvement. At the ankle the inverted pendulum model sees the COM passing forward along the medial border to the weight-bearing foot. The model predicts that during single support the body is falling forward and being accelerated medially towards the future position of the swing foot. The model predicts an insignificant role of the ankle invertors/evertors in the control. Rather, the future position of the swing foot is the critical variable or more specifically the lateral displacement from the COM at the start of single support. The position is actually under the control of the hip abd/adductors during the previous early swing phase. The critical importance of the hip abductors/adductors in balance during all phases of standing and walking is now evident. This separate mechanism is important from a neural control perspective and clinically it focuses major attention on therapy and potential problems with some surgical procedures. On the other hand the minuscule role of the ankle invertors/evertors is important to note. Except for the tandem standing position these muscles have negligible involvement in balance control.},

@article{Featherstone2010,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new method for calculating operational-space
inertia matrices, and other related quantities, for branched kinematic
trees. It is based on the exploitation of branch-induced sparsity
in the joint-space inertia matrix and the task Jacobian. Detailed
cost figures are given for the new method, and its efficacy is demonstrated
by means of a realistic example based on the ASIMO Next-Generation
humanoid robot. In this example, the new method is shown to be 6.7
times faster than the basic matrix method, and 1.6 times faster than
the efficient low-order algorithm of Rodriguez et al. Furthermore,
cost savings of more than 50,000 arithmetic operations are obtained
in the calculation of the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse of the task
Jacobian and its null-space projection matrix. Additional examples
are considered briefly, in order to further compare the new method
with the algorithm of Rodriguez et al. 10.1177/0278364909357644},

@article{Kulic2007,
	Abstract = {Safe planning and control is essential to bringing human-robot interaction
into common experience. This paper presents an integrated human?robot
interaction strategy that ensures the safety of the human participant
through a coordinated suite of safety strategies that are selected
and implemented to anticipate and respond to varying time horizons
for potential hazards and varying expected levels of interaction
with the user. The proposed planning and control strategies are based
on explicit measures of danger during interaction. The level of danger
is estimated based on factors influencing the impact force during
a human-robot collision, such as the effective robot inertia, the
relative velocity and the distance between the robot and the human.
A second key requirement for improving safety is the ability of the
robot to perceive its environment, and more specifically, human behavior
and reaction to robot movements. This paper also proposes and demonstrates
the use of human monitoring information based on vision and physiological
sensors to further improve the safety of the human robot interaction.
A methodology for integrating sensor-based information about the
user's position and physiological reaction to the robot into medium
and short-term safety strategies is presented. This methodology is
verified through a series of experimental test cases where a human
and an articulated robot respond to each other based on the human's
physical and physiological behavior.},

	Abstract = {A novel embedded distributed capacitive tactile sensor system designed
to be installed on humanoid robots is presented. It provides pressure
and shape information about the contacts with objects and the environment.
The system is based on conformable mesh of sensors having triangular
shape, interconnected in order to form a networked structure. Each
triangle is a flexible substrate allowing the sensor to be conformed
to smooth curved surfaces. It provides 12 capacitive measurements
and it has three communications ports placed along its sides: one
for the input from an adjacent triangle, and the others as outputs
toward adjacent triangles. Each triangle is therefore a single sensor
module implementing 12 taxels. The measurements are sent to microcontroller
boards using serial bus communication links. A microcontroller board
set-up and reads the data coming from a group of modules. Every microcontroller
board has a CAN-bus link. The spatial resolution of the skin is one
sensor every 5mm. The aim of the project is to install the artificial
skin on the humanoid robot iCub, for studying control strategy using
tactile feedback coming from the whole body, but it can be used for
many other different mechatronic applications where distributed pressure
information along a surface are required},

	Abstract = {We describe a humanoid robot platform {\^A} the iCub {\^A} which was designed
to support collaborativeresearch in cognitive development through
autonomous exploration and social interaction. Themotivation for
this effort is the conviction that significantly greater impact can
be leveraged by adoptingan open systems policy for software and hardware
development. This creates the need for a robusthumanoid robot that
offers rich perceptuo-motor capabilities with many degrees of freedom,
a cognitivecapacity for learning and development, a software architecture
that encourages reuse \& easy integration,and a support infrastructure
that fosters collaboration and sharing of resources. The iCub satisfies
all ofthese needs in the guise of an open-system platform which is
freely available and which has attracted agrowing community of users
and developers. To date, twenty iCubs each comprising approximately
5000mechanical and electrical parts have been delivered to several
research labs in Europe and to one in theUSA.},

@article{Rude1997,
	Abstract = {This paper handles the problem of collision avoidance in a multi-robot
environment. To solve this problem, the motion processes of the mobile
robots are modelled in space-time. Since the robots are autonomous
and communication is non-deterministic, there is temporal uncertainty
in addition to spatial uncertainty. The paper presents a method to
model both uncertainty components in a homogeneous way. It is shown,
that it is not sufficient to guarantee a spatial security distance
between the robots. Distances in space-time and space-time vectors
must be considered. The main result of this paper is a straightforward
and efficient solution to the problem of collision avoidance between
up to three mobile robots by applying a space-time displacement vector.
The solution is based on space-time, which is a helpful view onto
our world in relativity theory and quantum physics. Space-time methods
are also very valuable in Robotics, especially for problems in dynamic
environments and for motion coordination of mobile robots. Practical
experiments with up to two robots, and simulations of up to three
robots have been performed and are reported.},

@book{SciaviccoSiciliano,
	Abstract = {<P>Fundamental and technological topics are blended uniquely and developed
clearly in nine chapters - with a gradually increasing level of complexity.
A wide variety of relevant problems is raised throughout, and the
proper tools to find engineering-oriented solutions are introduced
and explained, step by step.</P> <P>Fundamental coverage includes
kinematics, statics and dynamics of manipulators, and trajectory
planning and motion control in free space.</P> <P>Technological aspects
include actuators, sensors, hardware- and software-control architectures
and industrial robot-control algorithms.</P> <P>Furthermore, established
research results involving description of end-effector orientation,
closed kinematic chains, kinematic redundancy and singularities,
dynamic parameter identification, robust and adaptive control, and
force and motion control are provided.</P> <P>To provide readers
with a homogeneous background, three appendices are included on linear
algebra, rigid-body mechanics, and feedback control.</P> <P>To impart
practical skill, more than 50 examples and case studies are carefully
worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort
to simulation. In addition, more than 80 end-of-chapter exercises
are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual containing
the MATLAB<SUP>{\^A}{\textregistered}</SUP> code for computer problems; this is available
from the publisher free of charge to those adopting this volume as
a textbook for courses.</P>},

@article{Sisbot2010,
	Abstract = {With robotics hardware becoming more and more safe and compliant,
robots are not far from entering our homes. The robot, that will
share the same environment with humans, will be expected to consider
the geometry of the interaction and to perform intelligent space
sharing. In this case, even the simplest tasks, e.g. handing over
an object to a person, raise important questions such as: where the
task should be achieved?; how to place the robot relatively to the
human in order to ease the human action?; how to hand over an object?;
and more generally, how to move in a relatively constrained environment
in the presence of humans? In this paper we present an integrated
motion synthesis framework from planning to execution that is especially
designed for a robot that interacts with humans. This framework,
composed of Perspective Placement, Human Aware Manipulation Planner
and Soft Motion Trajectory Planner, generates robot motions by taking
into account humans safety; his vision field and his perspective;
his kinematics and his posture along with the task constraints.},

@article{Yang2000,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel neural network approach to real-time collision-free
path planning of robot manipulators in a nonstationary environment
is proposed, which is based on a biologically inspired neural network
model for dynamic trajectory generation of a point mobile robot.
The state space of the proposed neural network is the joint space
of the robot manipulators, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized
by a shunting equation or an additive equation. The real-time robot
path is planned through the varying neural activity landscape that
represents the dynamic environment. The proposed model for robot
path planning with safety consideration is capable of planning a
real-time comfortable path without suffering from the too close nor
too far problems. The model algorithm is computationally efficient.
The computational complexity is linearly dependent on the neural
network size. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through
simulation studies.},
