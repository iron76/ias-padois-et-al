	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were: a) to examine the effect of verbal instructions given to the subjects on the control of lower extremity stiffness and b) to determine the effect of leg stiffness on mechanical energetic processes during drop jumps on a sprung surface. METHODS: A total of 10 female athletes performed a series of drop jumps on a sprung surface from heights of 20 and 40 cm. The instructions given to the subjects were a) "jump as high as you can" and b) "jump high a little faster than at your previous jump." The jumps were performed at each height until the athlete could not achieve a shorter ground contact time. Four jumps per subject per height were analyzed. The ground reaction forces were measured using a "Kistler" force plate (1000 Hz). The athletes' body positions were recorded using a high-speed (250 Hz) video camera. The deformation of the sprung surface was determined by another high-speed camera operating at 500 Hz. Surface EMG was used to measure muscle activity in five leg muscles. RESULTS: The contact time showed high correlation with leg stiffness as well as with ankle and knee stiffness. The change in leg stiffness was not due to the duration of the preactivation but rather to the level of activation during this phase. An increase in leg stiffness caused an increase in the energy stored and recovered in and by the sprung surface and a decrease of the energy produced by the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: By influencing contact time through verbal instructions, it is possible to control leg stiffness. Maximal vertical take-off velocity of the center of mass and maximal take-off body energy can be achieved having different levels of leg stiffness. The maximization of mechanical power is achieved by optimal leg stiffness values and leg muscle preactivation levels.},

	Abstract = {Robots come into physical contact with humans in both experimental and operational settings. Many potential factors motivate the detection of human contact, ranging from safe robot operation around humans, to robot behaviors that depend on human guidance. This article presents a review of current research within the field of Tactile HumanRobot Interactions (Tactile HRI), where physical contact from a human is detected by a robot during the execution or development of robot behaviors. Approaches are presented from two viewpoints: the types of physical interactions that occur between the human and robot, and the types of sensors used to detect these interactions. We contribute a structure for the categorization of Tactile HRI research within each viewpoint. Tactile sensing techniques are grouped into three categories, according to what covers the sensors: (i) a hard shell, (ii) a flexible substrate or (iii) no covering. Three categories of physical HRI likewise are identified, consisting of contact that (i) interferes with robot behavior execution, (ii) contributes to behavior execution and (iii) contributes to behavior development. We populate each category with the current literature, and furthermore identify the state-of-the-art within categories and promising areas for future research.},

	Abstract = {Demonstration learning is a powerful and practical technique to develop robot behaviors. Even so, development remains a challenge and possible demonstration limitations can degrade policy performance. This work presents an approach for policy improvement and adaptation through a tactile interface located on the body of a robot. We introduce the Tactile Policy Correction (TPC) algorithm, that employs tactile feedback for the refinement of a demonstrated policy, as well as its reuse for the development of other policies. We validate TPC on a humanoid robot performing grasp-positioning tasks. The performance of the demonstrated policy is found to improve with tactile corrections. Tactile guidance also is shown to enable the development of policies able to successfully execute novel, undemonstrated, tasks.},

@article{Asai2009,
	Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to compare two different feedback controllers for the stabilization of quiet standing in humans, taking into account that the intrinsic ankle stiffness is insufficient and that there is a large delay inducing instability in the feedback loop: 1) a standard linear, continuous-time PD controller and 2) an intermittent PD controller characterized by a switching function defined in the phase plane, with or without a dead zone around the nominal equilibrium state. The stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincar\'{e} maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is off when the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is on otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains (P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements in humans.},

@article{Babic2001,
	Abstract = {The aim of the experiment reported here was to determine the static and dynamic stability of two-point stance phases when walking on hands and knees at different speeds. In addition, we defined the methods and predicted the consequences of including two-point stance phases into crutch assisted functional electrical stimulation (FES) walking. Crawling on hands and knees was performed at three speeds by five healthy male persons. With twelve joint-position markers placed on the subject, we determined two stability indices for every instant of gait. We analysed the peak values of these two indices during the two-point stance phases. The results indicate that we have to ensure the proper position of the centre of gravity to increase the speed of walking. To reach speeds, lower than 0.6 m/s, it is not necessary to include statically unstable phases. The shift of the centre of gravity towards and across the leading stability edge can result in getting into the dynamically unstable state. Considering the results we can effectively introduce two-point stance phases into crutch assisted FES walking and therefore increase the speed and energy effectiveness of walking},

	Abstract = {A new algorithm for computing contact forces between solid objects with friction is presented. The algorithm allows a mix of contact points with static and dynamic friction. In contrast to previous approaches, the problem of computing contact forces is not transformed into an optimization problem. Because of this, the need for sophisticated optimization software packages is eliminated. For both systems with and without friction, the algorithm has proven to be considerably faster, simpler, and more reliable than previous approaches to the problem. In particular, implementation of the algorithm by nonspecialists in numerical programming is quite fea- sible.},

	Abstract = {Many critical elements for statically stable walking for legged robots have been known for a long time, including stability criteria based on support polygons, good foothold selection, recovery strategies to name a few. All these criteria have to be accounted for in the planning as well as the control phase. Most legged robots usually employ high gain position control, which means that it is crucially important that the planned reference trajectories are a good match for the actual terrain, and that tracking is accurate. Such an approach leads to conservative controllers, i.e. relatively low speed, ground speed matching, etc. Not surprisingly such controllers are not very robust - they are not suited for the real world use outside of the laboratory where the knowledge of the world is limited and error prone. Thus, to achieve robust robotic locomotion in the archetypical domain of legged systems, namely complex rough terrain, where the size of the obstacles are in the order of leg length, additional elements are required. A possible solution to improve the robustness of legged locomotion is to maximize the compliance of the controller. While compliance is trivially achieved by reduced feedback gains, for terrain requiring precise foot placement (e.g. climbing rocks, walking over pegs or cracks) compliance cannot be introduced at the cost of inferior tracking. Thus, model-based control and - in contrast to passive dynamic walkers - active balance control is required. To achieve these objectives, in this paper we add two crucial elements to legged locomotion, i.e., floating-base inverse dynamics control and predictive force control, and we show that these elements increase robustness in face of unknown and unanticipated perturbations (e.g. obstacles). Furthermore, we introduce a novel line-based COG trajectory planner, which yields a simpler algorithm than traditional polygon based methods and creates the appropriate input to our control system.We show results from bot- h simulation and real world of a robotic dog walking over non-perceived obstacles and rocky terrain. The results prove the effectivity of the inverse dynamics/force controller. The presented results show that we have all elements needed for robust all-terrain locomotion, which should also generalize to other legged systems, e.g., humanoid robots.},

	Abstract = {To manipulate objects or to use tools we must compensate for any forces arising from interaction with the physical environment. Recent studies indicate that this compensation is achieved by learning an internal model of the dynamics, that is, a neural representation of the relation between motor command and movement. In these studies interaction with the physical environment was stable, but many common tasks are intrinsically unstable. For example, keeping a screwdriver in the slot of a screw is unstable because excessive force parallel to the slot can cause the screwdriver to slip and because misdirected force can cause loss of contact between the screwdriver and the screw. Stability may be dependent on the control of mechanical impedance in the human arm because mechanical impedance can generate forces which resist destabilizing motion. Here we examined arm movements in an unstable dynamic environment created by a robotic interface. Our results show that humans learn to stabilize unstable dynamics using the skillful and energy-efficient strategy of selective control of impedance geometry.},

	Abstract = {In many human movement studies angle-time series data on several groups of individuals are measured. Current methods to compare groups include comparisons of the mean value in each group or use multivariate techniques such as principal components analysis and perform tests on the principal component scores. Such methods have been useful, though discard a large amount of information. Functional data analysis (FDA) is an emerging statistical analysis technique in human movement research which treats the angle-time series data as a function rather than a series of discrete measurements. This approach retains all of the information in the data. Functional principal components analysis (FPCA) is an extension of multivariate principal components analysis which examines the variability of a sample of curves and has been used to examine differences in movement patterns of several groups of individuals. Currently the functional principal components (FPCs) for each group are either determined separately (yielding components that are group-specific), or by combining the data for all groups and determining the FPCs of the combined data (yielding components that summarize the entire data set). The group-specific FPCs contain both within and between group variation and issues arise when comparing FPCs across groups when the order of the FPCs alter in each group. The FPCs of the combined data may not adequately describe all groups of individuals and comparisons between groups typically use t-tests of the mean FPC scores in each group. When these differences are statistically non-significant it can be difficult to determine how a particular intervention is affecting movement patterns or how injured subjects differ from controls. In this paper we aim to perform FPCA in a manner allowing sensible comparisons between groups of curves. A statistical technique called common functional principal components analysis (CFPCA) is implemented. CFPCA identifies the common sources of variation evident across groups but allows the order of each component to change for a particular group. This allows for the direct comparison of components across groups. We use our method to analyze a biomechanical data set examining the mechanisms of chronic Achilles tendon injury and the functional effects of orthoses.},

The general algorithm achieves O(log(n)) time complexity on O(n) processors for all kinematic trees and a large subset of closed loop systems.This paper also presents a more accurate version of the algorithm and the results of some numerical accuracy tests that compare both versions with the standard articulated body algorithm. The tests use rigid body systems containing up to 1024 bodies, and they show that the divide and conquer algorithm is substantially less accurate than the best serial algorithm but still accurate enough to be useful.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a recursive, divide-and-conquer algorithm for calculating the forward dynamics of a robot mechanism, or general rigid-body system, on a parallel computer. It features O(log(n)) time complexity on O(n) processors and is the fastest available algorithm for a computer with a large number of processors and low communications costs. It is an exact, noniterative algorithm and is applicable to mechanisms with any joint type and any topology, including branches and kinematic loops. The algorithm works by recursive application of a formula that constructs the articulatedbody equations of motion of an assembly from those of its constituent parts. The inputs to this formula are the equations of motion of two independent subassemblies, plus a description of how they are to be connected, and the output is the equation of motion of the assembly. Starting with a collection of unconnected rigid bodies, the equations of motion of any rigid-body system can be constructed by repeated application of this formula. This paper, being the first in a two-part series, presents an overview of the new algorithm and a detailed description of the simplest case: unbranched kinematic chains. Details of the general case are presented in Part 2.},

@article{Forner-Cordero2005,
	Abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) has not been very much in vogue within the field of movement coordination even though it is useful to reduce data dimensionality and to reveal underlying data structures. Traditionally, studies of coordination between two joints have predominantly made use of relative phase analyses. This has resulted in the identification of principal constraints that govern the Central Nervous System's organization and the control of coordination patterns. However, relative phase analyses on pairwise joints have some drawbacks because they are not optimal for revealing convergent patterns among multijoint coordination modes and for unraveling generic control strategies. In this paper, we present a method to analyze multijoint coordination based on the properties of PC, more specifically the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The comparison between relative phase analysis and PCA shows that both provide similar and consistent results, underscoring the latter technique's sensitivity to the study of coordination performance. In addition, it provides a method for automatic pattern detection as well as an index of performance for each joint within the context of the global coordination pattern. Finally, the merit of the PCA technique within the context of central pattern generators (CPG) will be discussed.},

	Abstract = {Sit-to-stand movements are a fundamental daily activity and a prerequisite to upright posture. Previous simulations of spinal cord injured individuals using functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) suggested a forward foot placement would reduce hand-support forces. However, this recommendation has proved to be difficult for able-bodied individuals standing hands-free and for individuals with spinal cord injuries standing with a walker. This inverse model is a step towards the goal of using forward simulations to determine efficient sit-to-stand strategies. Initial seated postures varied from 80-110 degrees of knee flexion and 90-120 degrees of hip flexion. Realistic progressions of lower extremity joint angles including development of linear momentum were created using sigmoid functions. These kinematic values were used to estimate the required resultant joint torques to complete sit-to-stand. Joint torque values that act to raise the body were combined to indicate sit-to-stand difficulty from different seated postures. A representative foot-forward placement (knee 80 degrees, hip 90 degrees) resulted in a maximum combined torque of 544 Nm. In contrast, a representative foot-back placement (knee 110 degrees, hip 120 degrees) resulted in a maximum combined torque of 661 Nm. An intermediate seated posture (knee 97 degrees, hip 90 degrees) produced the lowest maximum combined torque of 401 Nm (2 Nm ankle plantarflexion, 201 Nm knee extension, 198 Nm hip extension). Foot-forward placement required substantial ankle dorsiflexion torques. The most efficient strategy appeared to be combining a foot back placement with momentum generation using hip flexion. By generalizing the sit-to-stand model beyond FNS-driven movements, further insight may be gained into other populations (i.e., elderly).},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an effective framework of human-humanoid robot physical interaction. Its key component is a new control technique for full-body balancing in the presence of external forces, which is presented and then validated empirically. We have adopted an integrated system approach to develop humanoid robots. Herein, we describe the importance of replicating human-like capabilities and responses during human-robot interaction in this context. Our balancing controller provides gravity compensation, making the robot passive and thereby facilitating safe physical interactions. The method operates by setting an appropriate ground reaction force and transforming these forces into full-body joint torques. It handles an arbitrary number of force interaction points on the robot. It does not require force measurement at interested contact points. It requires neither inverse kinematics nor inverse dynamics. It can adapt to uneven ground surfaces. It operates as a force control process, and can therefore, accommodate simultaneous control processes using force-, velocity-, or position-based control. Forces are distributed over supporting contact points in an optimal manner. Joint redundancy is resolved by damping injection in the context of passivity. We present various force interaction experiments using our full-sized bipedal humanoid platform, including compliant balance, even when affected by unknown external forces, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.},

We first obtain the stable region of the GZMP on the floor. Moreover, since the difference between these two ZMPs corresponds to the magnitude of contact force applied by the hands, we propose the pushing manipulation by a humanoid robot by modifying the desired ZMP trajectory for a humanoid.

The planner allows contact with any pre-designated part of the robots body, since the use of hands or knees (in addition to feet) may be required to balance. It uses a probabilistic, sample-based approach to compute each step. One challenge of this approach is that most randomly sampled configurations do not satisfy all motion constraints (closed-chain, equilibrium, collision). To address this problem, a method of iterative constraint enforce- ment is presented that samples feasible configurations much more quickly.

	Abstract = {Background: Understanding how stability and/or maneuverability affects motor control strategies can provide insight on moving about safely in an unpredictable world. Stability in human movement has been well-studied while maneuverability has not. Further, a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during movement seems apparent, yet has not been quantified. We proposed that greater maneuverability, the ability to rapidly and purposefully change movement direction and speed, is beneficial in uncertain environments. We also hypothesized that gaining maneuverability comes at the expense of stability and perhaps also corresponds with decreased muscle coactivation. Materials and Methods: We used a goal-directed forward lean movement task that integrated both stability and maneuverability. Subjects (n=11) used their center of pressure to control a cursor on a computer monitor to reach a target. We added task uncertainty by shifting the target anterior-posterior position mid-movement. We used a balance board with a narrow beam that reduced the base of support in the medio-lateral direction and defined stability as the probability that subjects could keep the balance board level during the task. Results: During the uncertainty condition, subjects were able to change direction of their anterior-posterior center of pressure more rapidly, indicating that subjects were more maneuverable. Furthermore, medio-lateral center of pressure excursions also approached the edges of the beam and reduced stability margins, implying that subjects were less stable (i.e. less able to keep the board level). On the narrow beam board, subjects increased muscle coactivation of lateral muscle pairs and had greater muscle activity in the left leg. However, there were no statistically significant differences in muscle activity amplitudes or coactivation with uncertainty. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during a goal-directed whole-body movement. Tasks with added uncertainty could help individuals learn to be more maneuverable yet sufficiently stable.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports the applicability of our passivity-based contact force control framework for biped humanoids. We experimentally demonstrate its adaptation to unknown rough terrain. Adaptation to uneven ground is achieved by optimally distributed antigravitational forces applied to preset contact points in a feedforward manner, even without explicitly measuring the external forces or the terrain shape. Adaptation to unknown inclination is also possible by combining an active balancing controller based on the center-of-mass (CoM) measurements with respect to the inertial frame. Furthermore, we show that a simple impedance controller for supporting the feet or hands allows the robot to adapt to low-friction ground without prior knowledge of the ground friction. This presentation includes supplementary experimental videos that show a full-sized biped humanoid robot balancing on uneven ground or time-varying inclination.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an effective framework of human-humanoid robot physical interaction. Its key component is a new control technique for full-body balancing in the presence of external forces, which is presented and then validated empirically. We have adopted an integrated system approach to develop humanoid robots. Herein, we describe the importance of replicating human-like capabilities and responses during human-robot interaction in this context. Our balancing controller provides gravity compensation, making the robot passive and thereby facilitating safe physical interactions. The method operates by setting an appropriate ground reaction force and transforming these forces into full-body joint torques. It handles an arbitrary number of force interaction points on the robot. It does not require force measurement at interested contact points. It requires neither inverse kinematics nor inverse dynamics. It can adapt to uneven ground surfaces. It operates as a force control process, and can therefore, accommodate simultaneous control processes using force-, velocity-, or position-based control. Forces are distributed over supporting contact points in an optimal manner. Joint redundancy is resolved by damping injection in the context of passivity. We present various force interaction experiments using our full-sized bipedal humanoid platform, including compliant balance, even when affected by unknown external forces, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.},

Robovie can generate human-like behaviors by using human-like actuators and vision and audio sensors. Software is a key element in the systems development. Two important ideas in human-robot communication through research from the viewpoint of cognitive science have been obtained - one is importance of physical expressions using the body and the other is the effectiveness of the robot's autonomy in the robot's utterance recognition by humans. Based on these psychological experiments, a new architecture that generates episode chains in interactions with humans is developed. The basic structure of the architecture is a network of situated modules. Each module consists of elemental behaviors to entrain humans and a behavior for communicating with humans.},

	Abstract = {Sway is reduced by light nonsupporting touch between parts of the body and a fixed surface. This effect is assumed to reflect augmentation of sensory cues for sway by point-of-contact reaction forces. It has been shown that movement of the contact surface can increase sway relative to an earth-fixed contact. Light touch contact with another person, for example, holding hands, affords a moving contact due to partner sway. We asked whether interpersonal light touch (IPLT) would increase sway relative to standing alone. We expected effects on sway to vary as a function of the site of contact and the postural stability of each partner. Eight pairs of participants, standing in either normal bipedal or tandem Romberg stance with eyes closed and using IPLT (finger to finger or shoulder to shoulder) or no contact, provided 4 trials of 30-s duration in each of 12 posture-touch combinations. Sway (SD of the rate of change of upper trunk position at C7) was reliably less with IPLT compared with no contact, with two exceptions: in normal stance, shoulder contact with a partner in tandem stance, and in tandem Romberg stance, finger contact with a partner in the same stance, increased sway. Otherwise, the reduction in sway was greater with shoulder than with finger contact. Measures of interpersonal synchronization based on cross-correlations and coherence analysis between the partners' C7 movements suggest different control factors operate to reduce sway in IPLT with the hand or shoulder contact.},

	Abstract = {Many motor skills in humanoid robotics can be learned using parametrized motor primitives. While successful applications to date have been achieved with imitation learning, most of the interesting motor learning problems are high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems. These problems are often beyond the reach of current reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we study parametrized policy search methods and apply these to benchmark problems of motor primitive learning in robotics. We show that many well-known parametrized policy search methods can be derived from a general, common framework. This framework yields both policy gradient methods and expectation-maximization (EM) inspired algorithms. We introduce a novel EM-inspired algorithm for policy learning that is particularly well-suited for dynamical system motor primitives. We compare this algorithm, both in simulation and on a real robot, to several well-known parametrized policy search methods such as episodic REINFORCE, 'Vanilla' Policy Gradients with optimal baselines, episodic Natural Actor Critic, and episodic Reward-Weighted Regression. We show that the proposed method out-performs them on an empirical benchmark of learning dynamical system motor primitives both in simulation and on a real robot. We apply it in the context of motor learning and show that it can learn a complex Ball-in-a-Cup task on a real Barrett WAM robot arm.},

@article{Krishnamoorthy2004,
	Abstract = {Muscle synergies in postural tasks have recently been studied using the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis. A set of three hypothetical control variables, named M-modes, derived from the activity of 11 postural muscles, were identified. It was shown that postural synergies composed of these three M-modes preserve a certain shift of the center of pressure (COP) when subjects perform postural tasks while standing on a stable surface. In the present study we investigated the effects of support surface instability and availability of a light touch or grasp of a stable external support on the M-modes and their co-variation. The study was performed in two sessions. In the first session subjects released a load behind the body under four conditions: standing on a stable surface with no support (ST), standing on an unstable surface with no support (UN), standing on an unstable surface with a light touch (UN,T) and standing on an unstable surface with grasp of a stable object (UN,G). In the second session subjects performed two tasks: an arm movement backward and voluntary sway forward (towards the toes) under three conditions-ST, UN and UN,T. Principal component analysis was used to identify M-modes from data in the first session, and a UCM analysis was performed to study M-mode synergies in postural stabilization from data in the second session. A 'menu' of five M-modes was found, which were named either reciprocal M-modes or co-contraction M-modes based on the agonist-antagonist relationship of muscles comprising each mode. For a given task, subjects chose any three of these five M-modes in a subject- and task-specific manner. The reciprocal and co-contraction M-modes occurred equally frequently whether subjects stood on a stable or unstable support surface or whether a light touch was available or not. However, the co-contraction M-modes predominated when grasp of an object was available. In this condition, when the arm could be used for stabilization, there were M-modes uniting hip and shoulder muscles. However, the identified M-mode synergies were not found to lead to a consistent shift in the COP in any of the stability conditions. Possible reasons for this finding are discussed.},

Using an optoelectronic movement analyzer, the smallest compressed angles of the hip and ankle were measured during standing up and sitting down. The adopted strategies had significant effects on the smallest hip-compressed angle, but not the smallest ankle-compressed angle. Although cane use led to a larger trunk angular displacement than did chair-arm use, a cane can provide help during the whole transfer process.

We suggest that humans use both mechanisms: simple, fast sensor fusions with thresholding for automatic reactions (default mechanism), and more complex methods for voluntary movements. We suggest also that the fusion with thresholding mechanisms are optimized during phylogenesis but are mainly hardwired in any one organism, whereas sensorimotor learning and optimization is mainly a domain of the internal observers.},

The iCub satisfies all ofthese needs in the guise of an open-system platform which is freely available and which has attracted agrowing community of users and developers.

A current limitation of robotic systems is their inability to simultaneously and independently control both joint angle and joint stiffness without electromechanical feedback loops, which can reduce system stability. In this paper, we describe the development and physical implementation of a servo-actuated robotic joint that uses antagonistic, series-elastic actuation with novel nonlinear spring mechanisms. These mechanisms form a real-time mechanical feedback loop that provides the joint with angle and stiffness control through differential and common-mode actuation of the servos, respectively. This approach to joint control emulates the mechanics of antagonistic muscle groups used by animals, and we experimentally show that it is capable of independently controlling both joint angle and joint stiffness using a simple open-loop control algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Model-based control methods can be used to enable fast, dexterous, and compliant motion of robots without sacrificing control accuracy. However, implementing such techniques on floating base robots, e.g., humanoids and legged systems, is non-trivial due to under-actuation, dynamically changing constraints from the environment, and potentially closed loop kinematics. In this paper, we show how to compute the analytically correct inverse dynamics torques for model-based control of sufficiently constrained floating base rigid-body systems, such as humanoid robots with one or two feet in contact with the environment. While our previous inverse dynamics approach relied on an estimation of contact forces to compute an approximate inverse dynamics solution, here we present an analytically correct solution by using an orthogonal decomposition to project the robot dynamics onto a reduced dimensional space, independent of contact forces. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our approach on a simulated floating base bipedal humanoid robot and an actual robot dog locomoting over rough terrain.},

First we recorded demonstrations of sit-to-stand motions from normal human subjects as well as actors performing stylized standing motions (e.g. imitating an elderly person). Ground contact force information was also collected for these motions, in order to estimate the humans center of mass trajectory. We then mapped the demonstrated motions to the humanoid robot via an inverse kinematics procedure that attempts to track the humans kinematics as well as their center-of-mass trajectory. In order to estimate the robots center-of-mass position accu- rately, we additionally used an inertial parameter identification technique that fitmass and center-of-mass link parameters from measured force data.

The estimation of inertial parameters from data is a critical component for obtaining accurate models for control. However, floating base systems, such as humanoid robots, incur added challenges to this task (e.g. contact forces must be measured, contact states can change, etc.) In this work, we outline a theoretical framework for whole body inertial parameter estimation, including the unactuated floating base. Using a least squares minimization approach, conducted within the null-space of unmeasured degrees of freedom, we are able to use a partial force sensor set for full-body estimation, e.g. using only joint torque sensors, allowing for estimation when contact force measurement is unavailable or unreliable (e.g. due to slipping, rolling contacts, etc.). We also propose how to determine the theoretical minimum force sensor set for full body estimation, and discuss the practical limitations of doing so.},

The controller computes a desired wrench (force and torque) required to recover the posture when an unknown external perturbation has changed the posture of the robot. This wrench is later distributed as forces at predefined contact points via a constrained optimization, which aims at achieving the desired wrench while minimizing the Euclidean norm of the contact forces.

	Abstract = {One of the most general frameworks for phrasing control problems for complex, redundant robots is operational-space control. However, while this framework is of essential importance for robotics and well understood from an analytical point of view, it can be prohibitively hard to achieve accurate control in the face of modeling errors, which are inevitable in complex robots (e.g. humanoid robots). In this paper, we suggest a learning approach for operational-space control as a direct inverse model learning problem. A first important insight for this paper is that a physically correct solution to the inverse problem with redundant degrees of freedom does exist when learning of the inverse map is performed in a suitable piecewise linear way. The second crucial component of our work is based on the insight that many operational-space controllers can be understood in terms of a constrained optimal control problem. The cost function associated with this optimal control problem allows us to formulate a learning algorithm that automatically synthesizes a globally consistent desired resolution of redundancy while learning the operational-space controller. From the machine learning point of view, this learning problem corresponds to a reinforcement learning problem that maximizes an immediate reward. We employ an expectation-maximization policy search algorithm in order to solve this problem. Evaluations on a three degrees-of-freedom robot arm are used to illustrate the suggested approach. The application to a physically realistic simulator of the anthropomorphic SARCOS Master arm demonstrates feasibility for complex high degree-of-freedom robots. We also show that the proposed method works in the setting of learning resolved motion rate control on a real, physical Mitsubishi PA-10 medical robotics arm.},

	Abstract = {Learning robots that can acquire new motor skills and refine existing one has been a long standing vision of robotics, artificial intelligence, and the cognitive sciences. Early steps towards this goal in the 1980s made clear that reasoning and human insights will not suffice. Instead, new hope has been offered by the rise of modern machine learning approaches. However, to date, it becomes increasingly clear that off-the-shelf machine learning approaches will not suffice for motor skill learning as these methods often do not scale into the high-dimensional domains of manipulator and humanoid robotics nor do they fulfill the real-time requirement of our domain. As an alternative, we propose to break the generic skill learning problem into parts that we can understand well from a robotics point of view. After designing appropriate learning approaches for these basic components, these will serve as the ingredients of a general approach to motor skill learning. In this paper, we discuss our recent and current pro gress in this direction. For doing so, we present our work on learning to control, on learning elementary movements as well as our steps towards learning of complex tasks. We show several evaluations both using real robots as well as physically realistic simulations.},

	Abstract = {Today most robots interact with the surroundings only with their end-effectors. However there are many benefits to utilizing contact along the entire length of robot body and links especially for human-like robots. Existing control strategies for link contact require knowledge of the contact point. In an uncertain environment, locating link contact point is difficult for most robots as they do not possess skin capable of sensing. We propose a probabilistic approach to link contact estimation based on geometric considerations and compliant motions. Since for many robots, link geometry is also uncertain, we broaden our approach to simultaneously estimate link shape and environment contact. Our experimental results demonstrate that efficiency of control is significantly improved by link contact estimation},

However legged robots such as humanoids are inherently different as they are underactuated and subject to switching external contact constraints. Recently several methods have been proposed to create inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers for these robots. In an attempt to compare these different approaches, we develop a general framework for inverse dynamics control and show that these methods lead to very similar controllers. We are then able to greatly simplify recent whole-body controllers based on operational space approaches using kinematic projections, bringing them closer to efficient practical implementations. We also generalize these controllers such that they can be optimal under an arbitrary quadratic cost in the commands.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for modular motor control based on a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formulation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic control policies. Model-based control theory is used to convert the outputs of these policies into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, on-line modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstration. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB, and learning biped walking from demonstration in simulation, including self-improvement of the movement patterns towards energy efficiency through resonance tuning.},

By implication, other degrees of freedom are not controlled. We give an operational meaning to "controlled" and "uncontrolled" and describe a method of analysis through which hypotheses about controlled and uncontrolled degrees of freedom can be tested. In this conception, control refers to stabilization, so that lack of control implies reduced stability. The method was used to analyze an experiment on the sit-to-stand transition. By testing different hypotheses about the controlled variables, we systematically approximated the structure of control in joint space. We found that, for the task of sit-to-stand, the position of the center of mass in the sagittal plane was controlled. The horizontal head position and the position of the hand were controlled less stably, while vertical head position appears to be no more controlled than joint motions.},

The approach leverages the virtual-linkage model that provides a physical representation of the internal and CoM resultant forces with respect to reaction forces on the supporting surfaces. A grasp/contact matrix describing the complex interactions between contact forces and CoM behavior is developed. Based on this model, a new torque-based approach for the control of internal forces is suggested and illustrated on the Asimo humanoid robot. The new controller is integrated into the framework for whole-body-prioritized multitasking, thus enabling the unified control of CoM maneuvers, operational tasks, and internal-force behavior. The grasp/contact matrix is also proposed to analyze and plan internal force and CoM control policies that comply with frictional properties of the links in contact.},

@article{Shadmehr1994a,
	Abstract = {We investigated how the CNS learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

@article{Slijper2000,
	Abstract = {We investigated the role of additional perceptual information (finger touch) and additional mechanical support (hand grasp) on the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) associated with fast arm movements performed by standing subjects. The subjects performed fast, unilateral shoulder ante-flexion movements while standing on a stable force platform or on an unstable board with instability in a sagittal or in a frontal plane. Changes in the background activity of leg, trunk, and arm muscles and displacements of the center of pressure were quantified within time intervals typical for APAs. Leg and trunk muscles showed a significant drop in APAs with added finger touch and no further changes when the touch was substituted with hand grasp. Arm muscles showed no changes or a small drop in APAs with touch and a significant increase in APAs with grasp. These changes were seen during both stable and unstable standing. We conclude that APAs can show changes associated not only with mechanical aspects of a task, but also with its perceptual aspects. Based on the equilibrium-point hypothesis of motor control, an additional analysis of APAs was performed. With additional support, we observed a significant modulation of an index related to the co-activation of agonist-antagonist muscle pairs, while no changes in reciprocal activation were found. A similar analysis performed across all the leg and trunk muscles with respect to control of the center of mass lead to similar results. We conclude that the central nervous system seems to simplify adjustments of control patterns to changes in task parameters by modulation of only one of the two major central commands.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a model-based method, called Dynamic Balance Force Control (DBFC), for determining full body joint torques based on desired COM motion and contact forces for compliant humanoid robots. The center of mass (COM) dynamics are affected directly through contact force control to achieve stable balance. This idea is used to formulate DBFC considering the full rigid-body dynamics of the robot to produce desired contact forces. To achieve generic force control tasks, a virtual model controller, DBFC-VMC, is presented. Results presented from experiments on a force-controlled humanoid robot and simulation demonstrate the general purpose use of this control.},

The robot perceives and constructs a model of an environment filled with various fixed and movable obstacles, and automatically plans a navigation strategy to reach a desired goal location. The planned strategy consists of a sequence of walking and compliant manipulation operations. It is executed by the robot with online feedback. We give an overview of our NAMO system, as well as provide details of the autonomous planning, online grasping and compliant hand positioning during dynamically-stable walking. Finally, we present results of a successful implementation running on the humanoid robot HRP-2},

	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the design and control of actuators for machines and robots physically interacting with humans, implementing criteria established in our previous work 1 on optimal mechanical-control co-design for intrinsically safe, yet performant machines. In our Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA) approach, actuators control in real-time both the reference position and the mechanical impedance of the moving parts in the machine in such a way to optimize performance while intrinsically guaranteeing safety. In this paper we describe an implementation of such concepts, consisting of a novel electromechanical Variable Stiffness Actuation (VSA) motor. The design and the functioning principle of the VSA are reported, along with the analysis of its dynamic behavior. A novel scheme for feedback control of this device is presented, along with experimental results showing performance and safety of a one-link arm actuated by the VSA motor.},

Strictly derived from the minimization of instability, motion error, and effort, the controller compensates for the disturbance in the environment in interaction tasks by adapting feedforward force and impedance. In contrast with conventional learning controllers, the new controller can deal with unstable situations that are typical of tool use and gradually acquire a desired stabilitymargin. Simulations showthat this controller is a good model ofhumanmotor adaptation.Robotic implementations further demonstrate its capabilities to optimally adapt interactionwith dynamic environments and humans in joint torque controlled robots and variable impedance actuators, with- out requiring interaction force sensing.},
