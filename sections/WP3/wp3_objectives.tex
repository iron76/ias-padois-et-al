\paragraph{WP3: control and optimization of whole-body motion in contact (UPMC)}

The objectives of WP3 for the second year of the project are threefold. The first one is to demonstrate the applicability of state of the art whole-body motion controllers, such as the one developed in \cite{salini2012} and \cite{delprete2013}, on the iCub robot in multi-contact, goal oriented senarii (Task 3.4). The second one is to start exploring ways to enrich the retained whole-body controllers with the capability to interact with non-rigid environment (Task 3.3). The third one is to keep exploring potential ways of optimally coupling the local, reactive control level and the global, decision making one (Task 3.4).
