\paragraph{Work package 6 progress}

Activities within work package 6 achieved the expected results both in terms of administrative activities and management activities. As a major achievement, the management successfully concluded a second amendment to include INRIA as a partner. The inclusion was motivated by the the new position of Dr. Serena Ivaldi, currently researcher at INRIA, Nancy. 

\subparagraph{Administrative coordination (T6.1)}
Administration was successfully coordinated by IIT, with significant contribution from Chiara Andreoli (iCub Facility), Francesca Boscolo (project offices) and Maria Carmela Fierro (Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Science Department). The major activity concerned the amendment that the CoDyCo consortium asked the main reason being the fact that Serena Ivaldi, initially hired by UPMC and successively moved to TUD, was recently hired by INRIA as researcher. Part of the administrative coordination activities were also conducted during the mid-year meeting: November 20th-21st, 2014, Ljubljana.  Details on the meetings can be found in the CoDyCo website (\url{http://www.codyco.eu}).

\subparagraph{Software repository implementation (T6.2)}

The github software repository was several times restructured \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco} and the contribution from the different developers can be directly checked in the website.
