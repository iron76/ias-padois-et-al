\paragraph{WP2: understanding and modelling human whole-body behaviours in physical interaction (JSI)}

There were three main objectives within WP2 for the second year of the project: (i) to continue the work on designing of models for human whole body motion in contact where we aimed to form simplified models of high-level understanding of how additional supportive contacts affect human motor control strategies involved in balancing (Task 2.2). (ii) to study strategies that humans use in dealing with uncertanties in contact where we aimed to go beyond the work performed in Task 2.2 by putting human subjects in situations where they had to perform task oriented movements by interacting with either stiff, compliant, or upredictable supports. (iii) to get a deeper insight ito factors involved in human choice of contact utilization and to investigate how interaction through contacts can contribute to learning of whole body motor control (Task 2.4).
