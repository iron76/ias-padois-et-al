\paragraph{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body movements with contacts (UB)}

The overall goal of this work package is to develop software libraries and
software modules to be used as toolbox by the entire project consortium.  The
expected outcome for the second year were to develop such (shared) toolbox
that can be used by the entire group for implementing balancing and reaching
controllers with multiple contacts.
