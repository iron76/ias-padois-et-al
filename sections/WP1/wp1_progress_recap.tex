\paragraph*{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body
  movements with contacts (UB)}

WP1 objectives were achieved for the second year.  In summary, the main
accomplishments and impacts for the research community are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \texttt{codyco-superbuild} was released as open-source software
  which contains modules for balancing and reaching control for CoDyCo
  project.

\item Several control libraries for the iCub whole-body motion were developed
  and tested both in simulations and on the iCub.

\item An in-situ force/torque sensor calibration procedure was designed to
  improve the accuracy of whole-body identification.  The results are
  published in \cite{Traversaro2015b}.

\item Inertial parameters which are estimated from embedded force/torque
  sensors are used to improve torque estimation of the iCub.  The results are
  outlined in \cite{Traversaro2015}.

\item An experimental software library was released to perform
  maximum-a-posteriori dynamic estimation fusing multiple sensors and encoders
  of the iCub.  Computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the
  proposed method are studied and published in \cite{Nori2015} and
  \cite{Nori2015b}.
