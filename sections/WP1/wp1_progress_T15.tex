\subparagraph{Extension and enhancement of the iDyn library. (T1.5)} \label{sec:T15}

Goal of this task is to provide a reliable software tool for on-line
estimation of whole-body dynamics.  Before CoDyCo, dynamic estimations on the
iCub were relying on the iDyn software
library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/robotology/icub-main/tree/master/src/libraries/iDyn}.},
designed for fixed-base robots.  Within the first year of CoDyCo,
iDynTree\footnote{{\url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco/tree/master/src/libraries/iDynTree}}.}
was released in response to the need of representing floating base structures.
During the second year of the project, we investigated on the problem of
extending iDynTree to the case of multiple redundant sensors.  The
investigation resulted in an experimental software
library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/iron76/bnt_time_varying}.} currently
implemented in \textsc{Matlab}.  The software performs maximum-a-posteriori
dynamic estimation fusing multiple sensors such as gyroscopes, linear
accelerometers, embedded force-torque sensors and encoders.  Computational
efficiency is obtained by exploiting the sparsity of the underlying
problem \cite{Nori2015} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:varTimeComplete}).  Estimation
accuracy is obtained by a modified version of the expectation maximisation
algorithm \cite{Nori2015b} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:extForceEstimation}).
