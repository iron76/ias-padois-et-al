\paragraph{WP4: adaptation, Generalization and Improvement of Compliant Control and Tasks with Contacts (TUD)}

The goal of WP4 is to endow the CoDyCo humanoid robot control architecture with the core abilities for the
adaptation, generalization and self-improvement of both control laws and tasks that involve physical interaction
with humans, and the environment. In this context, we propose learning approaches that work in conjunction
with the control architecture devised in WP3 and rather complement analytical robotic approaches with on-policy
learning than starting from scratch. A core idea behind this work package is that Learning should complement
classical approaches and not supersede them.

The second year objectives of WP4 include:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fast regression methods that can deal with well structured input noise, such that physical models can
be learned and adapted for tasks that involve many uncertain contacts. A particular focus will be given to
prediction-based switching model.
% \item Approaches for immediate reward-based control model learning with uncertain state will be devised to ensure
% robust execution with online adaptation. Such approaches allow for learning operational space control laws with
% multiple compliant contacts.
\item Novel methods for imitation and reinforcement learning of skills with contact will be devised and tested. 
% These methods are based on hierarchical relative entropy policy search approaches (Daniel et al., 2012) and will be
% used both for learning tasks the local controllers of WP3.
\item Learning how to combine elementary tasks by imitation and reinforcement learning. The combinations involved
include the learned simultaneous use of elementary tasks, the sequential use as well as the co-articulation of
tasks.
\end{itemize}
