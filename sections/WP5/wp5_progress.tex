\paragraph{Work package 5 progress}

The activities in WP5 are divided into four tasks corresponding to the four years project duration. As a result, during the second year CoDyCo results concentrate on T5.2. The main result consist in the implementation of the validation scenario consisting of the balancing on different type of rigid contacts.

\subparagraph{Scenario 2: iCub posture control while performing goal directed actions (T5.2)}

The main contributions to T5.2 have been presented in ``Validation scenario2: balancing on feet while performing goal directed actions.'' which discusses the technical implementation of the second year validation scenario (see \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D5.2/pdf}). The software developed for the scenario implementation is released with an open-source license and distributed through github (\url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules} ). The main software activities include: a module to identify the whole-body motor transfer functions (\url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/modules/motorFrictionIdentification}), a module for estimating whole-body internal (joint torques) and external (contact) forces (\url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/modules/wholeBodyDynamicsTree}), a module for whole-body joint torque control (\url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/devices/jointTorqueControl}), a C++ module for whole-body control under multiple rigid contacts (\url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/modules/torqueBalancing}).
