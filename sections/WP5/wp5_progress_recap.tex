\paragraph*{WP5: systems integration, standardization and evaluation on the iCub robot (IIT)}

The second year WP5 activities have concentrated on the second year validation scenario. A complete description of the scenario can be found in ``D5.2 Scientific report on validation scenario 2: balancing on feet while performing goal directed actions.'' which discusses the technical implementation of the second year validation scenario (see \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D5.2/pdf}). With respect to the state of the art the work progress represents a step towards whole-body torque control under postural, contacts and goal-directed constraints. The integration of tactile feedback within the whole-body controller is a peculiarity of the implemented CoDyCo validation scenario and therefore represents yet another step forward with respect to the current state of the art.
